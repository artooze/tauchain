* some design questions to be answered:

1. the object language. can be either stlc+y (finitary PCF), or equivalently HORS, or, using the transfer theorem, have it MSOL just like the type language.
2. MSOL can be augmented with a fragment of counting FOL and remain decidable, while giving the possibility to speak about cardinalities of sets ([2]). need to see how it can fit.
3. need to decide whether MSOL will be used as type language directly, or, an automaton-based typesystem.
4. need a compositional typesystem (e.g. [3], there exists another one but for wMSO, i'm not yet aware of another MSOL one)
5. how can tau support multiple logics?
	- a nomic game may take into a consideration additional rules (that may be changed) that speak about "what is truth" and "what amounts as a proof".
	- seems like even prolog compiler can be written in MSOL, but need to think how truths/proofs from another logic may be "imported".
	- can such tau have only a fragment of full MSOL, and recover even more generalized logics via "trusted compilers"?
6. how good is the idea of using the transfer theorem and be able to use directly only MSOL over [algebraic] graphs? as the terms are regular graphs.
7. backtracking? ([5])

* first implementation tasks:
1. stlc+y
2. HORS
3. parity automata, collapsible pushdown automata(, ordered tree pushdown)
4. bohm trees
5. krivine machine
6. transfer theorem
7. parity games
8. logical reflection? ([4])
9. economical stlc+y <=> HORS ([1])
10. stlc+y => CPDA ([1])

* food for thought:
1. labels -> equivalences -> prefix orders -> trees

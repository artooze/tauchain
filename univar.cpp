/*
well we use stuff like term and termid and nodeid..
what other structure?
well this is preliminary, i will see when it compiles if it also links and then its done i guess
well doesn't ours operate over strings or.. you take the pointers so its the same?
well....yes it was strings and its nodeids now i think..or termids..still have to think it thru
its just a hack
well, maybe since we got the basic structure down and this is mostly
a big document of notes maybe we should just rewrite it into that
framework? theres no framework
hmm, i guess i mean to pull up master and 
afaik master has : experimental lambdas in prover, unintegrated p.cpp(?),
and i dunno if anything else (interesting?) it has the whole rest of
the system of parsing and all that stuff? it's a complete program
taht we add a part to,
 ambiguous cli is better ok that works :)
its just a hack...if it doesnt work out we scrap it
not sure what you mean just a hack
we have the system in ambiguous_cli with the whoel
command line, parser, and qdb generator, and that
qdb works off integer pointers so we should write it
into the prover.cpp there
write what what's in this univar.cpp here and what we're going
to make with the joins
well we make a new prover class here...whats the matter about what file it
is in, and also, we will keep the old prover for marpa
*/

/*ok we can try to continue where we left off yesterday i guessssss
lets leave it for a bit, i want to consult with naturalog about
his plans for 'real jit'ok, unless you're gung-ho to get started :)
well, not immediately but i guess i will want to 
btw wrt naturalog, he seems to be just reading up on lots of stuff,
ive read a bit about jitting prolog and im certain hmc has too
im 100% positive our version is important, and the only other
meaningful version would be this but native emit; i haven't read
hardly anything about it, but yea this version is important and i agree
about native emit
i dunno if naturalog is collecting resources to help with the native emit
version or hes just totally lost:) what do you think i think? :) i just
want to know if he's got anything so far
hehe i see, from my convo with him yesterday or whenever that was it 
didnt sound like he had much, if anything; seems to spend most of his
time reading about stats and watching physics lectures anyway, not bad
hobbies but they don't make a jit hehe
ok so then maybe i should consult with HMC on that instead, but...
i imagine a response along the lines of "where's the current jit?"
or maybe i should just scrap this whole plan to consult in the 
first-place lol
it would be nice if we could actually get naturalog to be working with
us though.. ever since we started the jit it's felt like a competition
his fault to begin with, but, i let it get the better of me and
now me and him are in somewhat of an adversarial relationship it seems,
or, rival at least.. and that's my fault
idk, maybe i just feel bad for snapping at him the other day and now
i'm trying to re-involve him

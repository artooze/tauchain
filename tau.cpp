//exactly, if the rest of the command line logic were set up over this it would be
//what i described below. because from here i imagine something like a 'batch file'
//which would just be a really long command line line..stuck into a file and
//interpreted with some option like --batch
//i mean as far as simplicity and consistency goes i think its pretty solid,
//"everything works the same wherever you're doing it... basically"

//yeah it sounds good
//this will definitely be good when its more complete and we get to bigger more serious
//testing, especially the batch files. two commands :) i'm thinking of is --kb and
//--kb_append and maybe 3 with a --kb_clear or something
//also in interpeter mode what happens if you enter a bad line? does it fail out or
//does it just give you a warning and give you a new line? ofc if we have the
//integration between command line, interpreter and batch files then in some cases
//we'd want one, and in some cases we'd want the other, sounds like a command line option
//--fail_on_error or --continue_on_error or something like that
//also, what about merging multiple files into a single kb?
//--kb file.n3 file.json file.nq  --query qfile1 qfile2 --kb-append file.n3 --query qfile3
// --kb-clear --kb_fail_on_error true  --kb file.n3  file2.n3 and etc.......
// ^ supposed to all be one command line
//and the -- options are just what you would do in between "fin."s and starting the
//next 'activity' (--kb, --kb-append, --query) etc. etc.

//these 'activities' not really any different whether its cli, batch file, interpreter
//mode or IRC bot (and especially these last two are identical)

	//ok, now i need to think it thru a bit more, so it will work more or less
	//like now.................
	//one thing i was thinking is that load_quads has it set up so that it will
	//work over both files and stdin in the interpreter mode (which i've got
	//prefixed with 'Tau>' now btw), was thinking whatever we set up the same things
	//could be done in interpreter mode and it would be essentially the same interface
	//command line commands essentially the same commands you'll give inside the
	//interpreter to direct the course of things. like say i want to run another query
	//after i'm done with my first one. right now Tau just exits.. but why?
	//is essentially the same as just reading the next file and doing something with it
	//from the commandline

	//also brings up the idea of "quit" command :) which could actually have use
	//already when i get into interpreter and didn't mean to.. it's cleaner and more
	//considerate than making them Ctrl+Z, even though i personally have no problems
	//with Ctrl+Z it's the thought that counts :) and could be a bigger thing later
	//if we need more graceful tau shutdown, which i'm sure we would down the road.
	//i agree down the road some sort of interpreter mode could be handy
	//i figure that's already what we have and if we expanded the command line like
	//we're talking about but kept it like it is now where it handles both files
	//and 'interpreter', i.e. plain './tau', then that's exactly what we'd get :)
	//tangential: we should bring back the IRC bot
	//actually not completely tangential :)
	//well..i will let you think about it:)
	//command line commands, interpreter mode, irc mode(?), im not sure how
	//to really approach any of it now
	//basically just like we are now in the code except with the revisions of the command
	//line like we've been talking about, and making these command line commands accessible
	//in the interpreter
	//basically, yeah
	//basically an interpreter and the command line is no different except one has input
	//from the user from the terminal and the other has input from files, and the commands/flags
	//are all the same, and it all works exactly the same either way you do it

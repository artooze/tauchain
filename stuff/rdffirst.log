#naturalog>	perhaps with time you understand martin lof position? :)
#adam789654123>	i hope so
#naturalog>	dont hope, try :)
#naturalog>	*instead* of trying to come up with something new
#adam789654123>	i was planning on more than wishing on a star
#adam789654123>	:P
#naturalog>	in fact, almost never try to come up with something new, even in 50 years when you'll be the greatest mathematician in the world
#adam789654123>	thats not my style
#naturalog>	new things are byproducts
#naturalog>	if they're a goal as for themselves, thats dangerous
#adam789654123>	yes, i agree
#adam789654123>	they are byproducts
#adam789654123>	and they happen
#naturalog>	thats what i said
#naturalog>	dont *try* to come up with something new
#adam789654123>	im not
#naturalog>	anyway i think i'll better go study some
#adam789654123>	ok naturalog 
#adam789654123>	fyi, i accept you
#adam789654123>	:)
#naturalog>	i accept and respect you too
#adam789654123>	:)
#adam789654123>	im not bothered that you think differently than me
#naturalog>	im bothered that you dont care about what the giants were really thinking
#adam789654123>	its part of the dynamic
#adam789654123>	you neednt be
#adam789654123>	you worry too much
#adam789654123>	:P
#adam789654123>	you dont get to fix everything
#adam789654123>	;)
#stoopkid>	yes i do so!
#stoopkid>	:P
#adam789654123>	haha
#adam789654123>	i know ive yet to learn stuff that will blow my mind
#adam789654123>	thats cool
#adam789654123>	i can accomodate
#adam789654123>	:)
#stoopkid>	its easy to come up with new math, but these days it's really hard to come up with new math that isn't isomorphic to old math
#stoopkid>	not impossible though! (as the HoTT advocators are demonstrating)
	#adam789654123 looks up isomorphic
#stoopkid>	ah woops, math jargon :)
#stoopkid>	basically the same structure but two different representations, the representations are 'isomorphic'
#stoopkid>	the literature can make that more exact
#adam789654123>	wiki seems to be saying that it allows for the inverse
#naturalog>	isomorphism is a structure preserving bijective mapping
#adam789654123>	ok
#stoopkid>	math jargon is a math jargon, yes
#adam789654123>	throw mud at the wall, and some of it sticks
#adam789654123>	the wall is my mind, the mud is your math jargon
#stoopkid>	so, a bijection is a mapping that is both an injection and surjection, so if the mapping is f from space A to space B (written as f: A->B) then each object in space A gets mapped to exactly one thing in B (that's the 'injective' part)
#stoopkid>	and, for each object in B, there's an object in A that maps to it, that's the 'surjection' part
#adam789654123>	ok
#adam789654123>	stoopkid: have you been reading that HoTT book?
#adam789654123>	by any chance....
#stoopkid>	haven't for a while
#adam789654123>	are you still up for the idris project?
#stoopkid>	yes
#adam789654123>	cool
#adam789654123>	i wasnt sure
#adam789654123>	either way, its something i want to do
#adam789654123>	but im glad to have you on board
#adam789654123>	:D
#stoopkid>	sure :) there's all kinds of block-chain things i'm interested in doing
#adam789654123>	it could be a very powerful tool
#adam789654123>	working with blockchains that is
#stoopkid>	indeed, tau will be a very powerful tool :)
#stoopkid>	ah
#stoopkid>	yea that's true, they're kinda the future of many things
#adam789654123>	and yes, the mock tau could help us alot
#adam789654123>	even in setting up naive systems
#adam789654123>	that might be useful for this or that
#adam789654123>	it could also help bring people on board to the larger project
#adam789654123>	at least if there was a prototype people could play with, then people could see the theory in action
#adam789654123>	i want to be one of those people
#adam789654123>	;)
#stoopkid>	probably, and heh same
#stoopkid>	what i'm *most* interested in at the current moment though is finding an alternative to proof-of-work that would be more appropriate for block-acceptance conditions for a decentralized wikipedia
#naturalog>	13:26 < adam789654123> are you still up for the idris project?
#naturalog>	oops mouse accident
#adam789654123>	:)
#adam789654123>	im not sure, but if you have a general proofer, then couldnt you cater it stoopkid ?
#adam789654123>	or use it to cater to that purpose?
#adam789654123>	could the problem be, how would deduction work in the given context?
#stoopkid>	"< adam789654123> or use it to cater to that purpose?" its possible but it's also overkill, and no i wouldn't say that's the problem
#stoopkid>	s/its possible/we could, yes/
#stoopkid>	basically the decentralized wikipedia doesn't necessarily need to be anything more than a system of linked files, doesn't necessarily need 'logic' incorporated into it
#adam789654123>	so no "proof of work" i guess?
#stoopkid>	well, proof-of-work for block-acceptance is completely different than Tau's notion of 'proving things in the logic system'
#stoopkid>	although it's ability to prove things in a logic system can be used to make block-acceptance conditions in Tau-code
#stoopkid>	but, if Tau still requires proof-of-work to get things onto a chain, then... putting the decentralized wikipedia onto a tau context kinda precludes the possibility of redefining the block-acceptance conditions to something besides proof-of-work
#naturalog>	the answer is easy: if that decent wiki needs a decent clock, then it must have pow. otherwise, it can do without
#naturalog>	decent(ralized)
#stoopkid>	i don't think pow is necessary, i think something similar to proof-of-play, or even a combination of conditions could be used to prevent the 51% attack
#naturalog>	it might be possible to replace pow, alas, no one could make it yet
#naturalog>	many many trials though
#stoopkid>	indeed, and i think it's worth attempting to figure out before i give up on it
#naturalog>	the good news is that on tau everything is replaceable, including if someone finds replacement to pow one day
#stoopkid>	ah, so even the pow part will be mutable?
#naturalog>	ofc
#stoopkid>	didn't know that
	#stoopkid takes note
#naturalog>	thats the very main point
#naturalog>	because we want to mutate without fork
#naturalog>	and the forking becomes a problem when changing the very blockchain protocol
#naturalog>	so the whole point is to have the very chain algo mutable
#naturalog>	exactly as core/xt, where the fork is about something much less significant than pow algo
#stoopkid>	i see, i had been under the impression that PoW would still underlie any other block-acceptance conditions, but, i hadn't really thought too much about it til recently i guess

#naturalog>	tau's protocol is self-defining
#naturalog>	at the root chain
#naturalog>	btw theres a concensus algo called dpos
#naturalog>	delegated proof of stake
#naturalog>	zennet's plan was to use this algo but them HMC_a came up with the so-called "kill switch" to show its not secure enough
#naturalog>	then

#tau-bot>	naturalog: No results found for 'dpos "kill switch" hunterminercrafter'.
#stoopkid>	https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=614917.320
#naturalog>	id say the second best concensus algo is ripple
#naturalog>	it enjoys a lot of very significant advantages
#naturalog>	but, its not 100% trustless decentralized
#naturalog>	(never meant to be)
#stoopkid>	well, i've been wondering towards the potential for crowd-sourcing the 'mining' with something similar to proof-of-play, perhaps something along the lines of recaptcha, i.e. something stuck into a commonly used online service that people have to 'solve' in order to prove they're human, and i figure something like this could be combined with other block-acceptance conditions
#stoopkid>	that, along with removing as many incentives for attacking the network as possible
#naturalog>	cf motocoin
#stoopkid>	indeed, something 'like' motocoin's proof-of-play would be much more.. 'appropriate', i figure
#stoopkid>	removing the coin incentive from the block-chain is a bit of a double-edged sword here too, on the one hand it removes incentive to attack the chain, on the other hand it removes incentive to maintain the chain
#stoopkid>	but, there's many many possibilities here for both making the chain more self-incentivizing and ensuring more 'stability'
#stoopkid>	so, i'm at least somewhat confident that i'll be able to find an alternative that's both viable and 'appropriate'

#koo7>	looks good, im just so lazy lately
#Maralis>	how relevant is lambda calculus to understanding tau-chain?
#Maralis>	or moreso, to how it computes?
#Maralis>	I assume it's relevant; I just haven't been paying attention lately
#stoopkid>	Maralis: ah, the tau language will be a dependently typed lambda calculus. it's not necessary to understand the details in order to use tau, but it's more important if you're looking at the theoretical side, like the benefits and trade-offs that come from being a (fully) dependently typed lambda calculus rather than a turing-complete logic
#Maralis>	Ah
#stoopkid>	but, long-story short, there aren't even really any trade-offs, it gets all the benefits of not being turing-complete and having a decidable logic *per block* on the block-chain, and then you can even recover turing-completeness by spanning multiple blocks
#stoopkid>	and if you *really* want to get deeper into it, prefix your questions with HMC_a :)
#stoopkid>	and also check the 2nd link in the topic about it: http://rbjones.com/rbjpub/logic/cl/tlc001.htm
#stoopkid>	Maralis: have you used a functional programming language like haskell or lisp before?
#Maralis>	Slightly
#Maralis>	I understand the theory more or less though
#Maralis>	but haven't done any extensive programming there
#Maralis>	and it wasn't in eithr Haskell or Lisp, though I've taken a lot of interest in Lisp
#stoopkid>	ah, which one have you used?
#stoopkid>	the logic expressed by the tau language will be equivalent in expressive capacity to Coq / Calculus of constructions, i.e. the top of that lambda cube in the page i linked ('full cube' for short)
#Maralis>	a mini-language that my IRC bot has that became Turing-complete after I added a couple features from functional languages, although it lacks variable binding
#stoopkid>	ah interesting, i'd like to check that out at some point
#Maralis>	it was originally created as a way for other users to define commands beginning with ^ in the chat since it already had an !eval function (with extensive filtering)
#Maralis>	and these commands can also reference other similar commands beginning with ^ as functions
#Maralis>	I've been planning on switching to whitelisting and rewriting to make it more secure
#stoopkid>	nice, sounds pretty cool, is it on github?
#Maralis>	Not currently
#stoopkid>	well lemme know if you put it up there (or if you wanna skip github and put it on the IPFS :)

#adam789654123>	hello all

#adam789654123>	whats going on?
#HumanistRobot>	I was talking about Tau last night in a coworking
#adam789654123>	cool
#adam789654123>	any opinions?
#HumanistRobot>	No, they don't got it
#adam789654123>	haha... ok
#adam789654123>	HumanistRobot: people dont need to get it to use it i guess, as long as people who do get it make tools for them
#HumanistRobot>	Good point
	#nilli (6dbab769@gateway/web/freenode/ip.109.186.183.105) has joined #zennet
#adam789654123>	Maybe they can get that point? ;)
#adam789654123>	like i dont need to know how a computer works in order to use it, so long as people have made tools that I can use with it
#HumanistRobot>	Great
#adam789654123>	its kind of funny, but think about this. general comprehension does not have a direct relationship with general adoption. I think the computer i a case in point. Think of how few understand have an intimate knowledge of computer architecture compared to how many use computers.
#stoopkid>	right, but how would you explain a computer to somebody before they've been built and popularized?
#adam789654123>	i guess they are sort of an evolution of the calculator?
#adam789654123>	or could be thought of as such?
#stoopkid>	a 'cal-cu-la-tor'?
#HMC_a>	I guess you would start by building and demonstrating a mechanical differencing engine?
#adam789654123>	i think what something like that was among the first highly sophisticated calculating machines?
#HMC_a>	koo7: what assertion error?
#adam789654123>	maybe for trigonometric tables?
#adam789654123>	but im fuzzy on the details
#stoopkid>	right, and somebody with absolutely no context for this stuff will be completely at a loss to understand the true meaning of your explanations
#adam789654123>	i can start off simple enough i think
#adam789654123>	as long as people can think to implication from elementary principals, if you can understand it, you should be able to explain it
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: they will see me turn the crank and see the machine subtract "on it's own"... and will understand, no further context is needed :-)
#HMC_a>	if they don't know what subtraction is, then you're screwed, I guess... :-)
#adam789654123>	^ implication of elementary principal
#stoopkid>	yep, that's what i mean, for people with no context to understand it, it needs to be built and demonstrated in a way that's meaningful to them (in the situation where the inner-workings are too complex for them to grok the real implications of it)
#adam789654123>	well..... many systems that we might consider unsuspecting could be turing equivalent
#adam789654123>	its actually quite the mathematical fasination
#nilli>	hi
#stoopkid>	for example, i really doubt that anybody i'm friends with off of IRC will ever understand Tau, or computers for that matter
#stoopkid>	hi nilli! :)
#adam789654123>	hi nilli
#stoopkid>	honestly, there's probably not even anybody i *know* IRL, let alone am friends with, that will ever understand it
#adam789654123>	maybe
#stoopkid>	so, i usually just explain decentralized autonomous organizations and the socio-economic nature of crypto-currency instead
#adam789654123>	most people get hung up on a word that tounds technical, and have a thought bubble that says some cliche thing about how they cant understand so they shouldnt try
	#hazirafel has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
#nilli>	they dont need to understand they need to see it work for something they need. One use a plow if they need to plow the land.
#adam789654123>	i agree with this also nilli 
#stoopkid>	yep, i've tried to explain the technical side a bit to a few people, and i'm pretty sure they've just completely mentally closed themselves off to any further explanations about it
#adam789654123>	^
#adam789654123>	its that first impressions thing
#adam789654123>	some people are dominated my trivial first impressions?
#adam789654123>	and cliches based on first impressions at that?
#adam789654123>	or first impressions based on cliches perhaps?
#stoopkid>	yep, this is why i don't think anybody who doesn't really really put in their own effort towards it will understand the meaning of tau until it's built and demonstrated
#adam789654123>	or as i said, you dont really need to understand it to use it, as long as people who do understand it builds your tools
	#stoopkid nods
#adam789654123>	if people need to understand how it works to use it, that could be considered a flaw in the design anyway, meaning, it must abstract something away, no?
#adam789654123>	even getting something to some extent doesnt mean that we understand the inner workings
#stoopkid>	i think mostly that's correct, but there might be a few situations where requiring understanding is not a flaw but a feature
#adam789654123>	yes... i agree
#adam789654123>	but these are certain kinds of tools, and they still abstract stuff away
#adam789654123>	but i agree
#adam789654123>	and as a general rule, this is the direction that i head in.... continual education
#nilli>	listen, the only thing that work in the world we live now is profit!!! if you can show a chance for profit it will rise if not it will have to wait until things will fall apart totally   
#adam789654123>	anything that effects efficiency effects profit indirectly
#adam789654123>	also, anything that effects collaberative capacity effects profit indirectly
#stoopkid>	nilli: economic profit or accounting profit? most accounting profit would more accurately be labeled rent
	#hazirafel (~hazirafel@176.106.226.239) has joined #zennet
#nilli>	believe in the fact  that it bring profit. profit like anything else is based on believe, nothing else.
#koo7>	HMC_a, well, univar2, ./tau  < examples/add is heap-buffer-overflow /home/kook/ClionProjects/tauchain/nquads.cpp:66:10 in old::nqparser::readiri(), --n3 gets stl_vector.h:780:16: runtime error: reference binding to null pointer of type 'int' followed by something funny wrt the cli,  And finally, adding "kb" and "query" to the file, .... im not getting it anymore, i got assertion error on rdf.cpp:67 assert(it->second->_type == r._type);
#koo7>	err i dont think that assertion error was with the modified version, rather with the original examples/add
#koo7>	env ASAN_OPTIONS="detect_leaks=0 verbosity=1" LD_PRELOAD=libmarpa/dist/.libs/libmarpa.so ./tau --n3  < examples/add
#koo7>	goes in a whacky loop
#koo7>	that looks like the cli is trying to parse the prover's debug output...
	#mmango (~mmango@unaffiliated/asdfasdffdsa) has joined #zennet
#nilli>	Stoopkid our entire economy is based on risk game. if you build a machine that gives you a better prediction rate you will win. I think that tau will be that machine. I dont think that most of you realize that. but that what it will be.
#stoopkid>	tau will be the framework on which that machine (and all subsequent such machines) are built
#stoopkid>	tau in and of itself doesn't give better prediction of real world things (until it's deciding real world things, ofc), this is more a matter of who's the best at collecting and managing and analyzing mass amounts of information
#stoopkid>	and whoever's the best at that probably wins.
#stoopkid>	also, unless a viable alternative to PoW is found, then tau will likely lead to centralization of influence with the ASIC manufacturers
#stoopkid>	at least, that's my prediction
	#sifar has quit (Quit: Leaving)
#nilli>	stoopkid decentralization organized in a communicative frame work is that prediction machine. (that what intelligence is too) .
#stoopkid>	one could say that the internet is such a framework though (and it is)
#stoopkid>	tau will be too, but then the applications that actually get built on top of tau, this is where it will really happen
#nilli>	the internet is information network not action network.
#stoopkid>	action network in what sense?
#nilli>	that is why it could bring us social network but not a different economic system
#nilli>	stoopkid action is the point in which your "yes" or "no" register the following state of the system. this will happened in the tau, it is not happening in the internet
#HumanistRobot>	+1
#stoopkid>	mm, it happens in the internet, just not quite the way we'd like it to, which tau will indeed fix
#stoopkid>	but, even that could be considered 'just a good start'
#nilli>	the influences in the internet are not direct they are centralized 
#stoopkid>	yep, this is why i brought up how PoW block-mining will naturally lead to centralization of influence with ASIC manufacturers and their associates
#nilli>	in the tau each move that you make is registered and have its local influence. just like in nature
#stoopkid>	each move you make that somebody mines onto the chain*
#nilli>	if you are part of the your action is registered, it is a transaction that have to be accounted for in term of conservation law.
#stoopkid>	but your transaction doesn't have to be accounted for
#nilli>	if you are a part of the system...
#stoopkid>	people can ignore your transaction
#nilli>	ofc it is. that is what the blockchain is about
#stoopkid>	mm, if transactions couldn't be ignored, then btc wouldn't have transaction fees
#nilli>	what?
#stoopkid>	if each transaction *had* to be mined onto the chain, there would be no reason for transaction fees to incentivize mining them, because people would just simply *have* to do it
#stoopkid>	but miners can pick and choose which blocks they mine
#stoopkid>	and they choose the most profitable ones
#stoopkid>	any transaction that doesn't make it onto the chain can be ignored

	#hazirafel has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
#tromp>	you claimed "PoW block-mining will naturally lead to centralization of influence with ASIC manufacturers"
#stoopkid>	well, that's my prediction anyway
#tromp>	then you must not believe in ASIC resistant PoW
#stoopkid>	how does it work?
#stoopkid>	rate-limiting the PoW?
#tromp>	it does minimal computation, and a ton of random reads and writes
#tromp>	so the ASIC is good old commodity DRAM
#tromp>	the PoW makes DRAM latency the bottleneck
#koo7>	i dont see how ram or asic or storage or whatever makes any difference, money = power
#tromp>	yes, more money buys more DRAM
#tromp>	but its commodity so no centralization
#stoopkid>	koo7: well, that's kind of why i'm looking for a way to design a block-chain without either PoW or a currency
#koo7>	stop looking into technological solutions and start looking into adding a human touch?
#stoopkid>	like proof-of-play? :P
#koo7>	more like web of trust
#stoopkid>	well, that's always a fall-back option
#stoopkid>	but, on large scales that can get messy
#stoopkid>	just takes accidentally trusting one malicious party
#stoopkid>	which anybody could become at any point in time
#stoopkid>	and, people aren't so great with their comp security, on average
#koo7>	youre thinking absolute trust, im thinking degrees
#stoopkid>	hm, i mean, web of trust might be able to work for something like a decentralized wiki, but.. i'm trying to picture how that might look
#koo7>	i would imagine maybe multiple assesments of each of your contacts, how much i trust your data and how i trust your judgement of your contacts

#stoopkid>	you mean buy agoras coins?
#Risky2>	yeah stoopkid 
#stoopkid>	naturalog would be the man for that, maybe he's around somewhere
#stoopkid>	it's like 4:30 am in israel though so probably not
#adam789654123>	tau-bot: tell naturalog "<Risky2> where can you buy tau after master exchange closes?"

#naturalog>	there isnt any other exchange for now (though poloniex might put it soon as well as omni's decentralized exchange)
#naturalog>	so inbetween we're back to the old days, by email or "contact us" at idni.org
#Risky2>	oh ok, thanks for the info naturalog 
#naturalog>	thanks for the interest :)
#Risky2>	are you a team member naturalog ?
#naturalog>	im ohad
#Risky2>	oh ok
#Risky2>	nice to meet you ohad 
#naturalog>	nice to meet you too :)
#naturalog>	you got to the right place to speak/ask about tua
#naturalog>	tau
#Risky2>	you guys seem to have a nice project going
#naturalog>	tx
#Risky2>	could you explain me how your economic model is sustainable if you arent busy right now?
#naturalog>	even if im busy you can ask and either i answer later or someone else answers
#Risky2>	ah ok, cool
#naturalog>	so no direct economic model - tau is a platform for decentralized economical models
#naturalog>	anyone can create their own decentralized (or not) app over tau
#Risky2>	oh ok, pretty good
#naturalog>	you can see list of links on tauchain.org there are docs there much more accessible than the whitepaper
#Risky2>	oh ok, will take a look there naturalog 
#naturalog>	tx
#Risky2>	have a good night :)
#naturalog>	if any night will be left for me :)
#Risky2>	hahaha hopefully there will
#naturalog>	:) not sure its better :)
#Risky2>	hahaha dont say that :)
#Risky2>	also one last question if you dont mind me asking, what will the supply of agoras be at launch naturalog ?

#koo7>	got rid of that shit!
#koo7>	stoopkid, would you be down for some js hacking?
#stoopkid>	what would we be doing?
#koo7>	visualizing the run of the prover
#stoopkid>	in the browser?
#koo7>	its not mandatory
#stoopkid>	how do you want it visualized
#koo7>	so, i want a slider
#koo7>	the prover will output binds, unbinds and binding failures, each would be a step on the slider
#koo7>	it will print out the kb, the text with be attributed with ruleid and some kind of varid
#koo7>	the page would include that text
#koo7>	the js would keep track of current binds with a table
#koo7>	the prover will output the events in json along the debug output, i will preprocess it with some python
#koo7>	sliding the slider to some point will have to, at the simplest implementation, do all the steps from 0 to there
#koo7>	then it has the table of binds, + it would look at the current step in case it is a failed bind, and it will draw arrows over the kb text, based on that
#koo7>	biab
#stoopkid>	sure
#koo7>	oh and ideally it would also display the raw debug output and scroll to lines as the slider moves:)
#koo7>	i was thinking the prover would output its thing, and i would run it thru python, preprocess everything, and output a static html/js page
#stoopkid>	static? you mean standalone?
#koo7>	right
#stoopkid>	hmm
#stoopkid>	each step should be a tree / collapsible heirarchical table
#koo7>	hmmmm
#stoopkid>	not to necessarily replace anything you said, but rather to go along with it
#stoopkid>	each node in the tree would either be a rule application or a coro, depending what we wanted to see (maybe two different views)
#koo7>	as long as its to go along with my idea, np:)
#stoopkid>	yea, it would just be taking those arrows we're drawing over the kb text and constructing an htable from them
#koo7>	hmm
#koo7>	what kind of hashtable?
#stoopkid>	heirarchical table
#koo7>	ah per coro/rule
#stoopkid>	yea
#koo7>	yeah that makes sense
#koo7>	i just wish i knew how we're gonna fit all that on one page, even my idea is already too much for one screen........
#stoopkid>	not really
#koo7>	well, at my zoom levels:)
#stoopkid>	well, that's what scrolling's for lol
#stoopkid>	could also put things into different tabs
#koo7>	theres no way that a js could talk to another js across tabs/windows, right?
#stoopkid>	i meant tabs inside the page
#stoopkid>	panes i guess
#stoopkid>	we can make it work, it's mainly about just showing slices at a time with easy navigating through different slices
#stoopkid>	and, along these lines, what should happen with the arrows being drawn over the kb when there's recursion?
#stoopkid>	once things start tracing back over themselves with recursion then you won't really be able to follow the lines
#koo7>	i would love if there was a way to make it work across multiple windows, i will google around, but if that fails, then its panes for sure
#koo7>	not sure what you want to slice
#stoopkid>	we could maybe use cookies for that
#koo7>	ah hmm local storage, sounds hopeful
#koo7>	dunno, havent thought about recursion
#stoopkid>	well, the htable expands those arrows and displays them as a heirarchy
#koo7>	that solves your recursion i guess
#stoopkid>	well, it just makes me wonder if we should even draw the arrows over the kb that way at all, since things just get lost in recursion
#koo7>	i want to debug kbs
#stoopkid>	perhaps would be better to show an animation of it
#koo7>	well thats what the slider is for
#koo7>	im supposing to catch bugs in kbs even before any recursion occurs
#stoopkid>	ah, well, that works then
#koo7>	http://www.jstorage.info/
#koo7>	lets keep this jstorage-ability in mind but make something simple without it now
#stoopkid>	alright
#stoopkid>	so, you're going to generate json files with all this info?
#koo7>	well i was thinking i could do more processing in python, since i dont need any help for that, and spit out a finished page based on some template
#koo7>	it can directly mark up the kb text with attributes
#koo7>	and add the raw log
#koo7>	well i guess some escaping will be needed
#koo7>	you have more exp with js so you could do strictly what has to be done in js
#koo7>	putting the slider in place, drawing the arrows
#koo7>	etc
#stoopkid>	sure, i'll need to see what the format's gonna be though
#koo7>	i need to think what the coro tree view would require
#koo7>	and then implement everything
#stoopkid>	hmm, these files will be rather large
#koo7>	depends
#koo7>	so im thinking bind, unbind, fail, coroin, coroout, rulein, ruleout?
#stoopkid>	something like that
#stoopkid>	and then i can build up a state by tracing over it
#koo7>	yes
#koo7>	i suppose coroin would have the name of the coro as a parameter
#koo7>	and rulein the rule string
#koo7>	or id?
#koo7>	bind/unbind/fail would have like i said the ruleid + varid
#koo7>	two of each i guess
#stoopkid>	hmm
#stoopkid>	think of it just in terms of mutations of the graph we're visualizing, and then output those mutations in a purely abstract, graph-mutation format
#stoopkid>	from the perspective of the js trying to visualize this sliding/changing graph, the reason for the changes is irrelevant
#koo7>	you mean the bindings graph?
#koo7>	well bind and unbind are the changes
#stoopkid>	from the logic perspective they are
#stoopkid>	so, bind = some graph mutation
#stoopkid>	so rather than output bind, output that intended mutation
#koo7>	ok fair point, in that case i want to output "step xxx" "add yyy" "remove zzz" "step xxx+1" "add fff"...
#koo7>	and instead of just fails have explicit adds and removes
#stoopkid>	yea, so i guess in the python you would be mapping that logic perspective to this graph perspective, and then in the js i'd just be making an abstract graph interface
#koo7>	yeah\
#koo7>	i guess i can do the grouping into step objects in the python too
#stoopkid>	i'm not necessarily sure it makes sense to handle the templating in python though
#stoopkid>	the whole thing has to be interactive anyway so it makes more sense to just generate the page in js
#stoopkid>	and you can just put your templates in part of the HTML code
#koo7>	well, more work on the js side, less on the python side
#koo7>	no change for the c++ side, which is where i will begin anyway:)
#stoopkid>	maybe, i guess i'm just trying to go for unix philosophy with it
#koo7>	consider how much you want to get involved, personally, most of all i want something useful for debugging our test cases quick, and that means the minimal functionality i originally outlined
#koo7>	at any case i dont think i will start on the c++ side earlier than tonight
#koo7>	could take me a night or a few days..:)
#koo7>	then the generic python preprocessing
#stoopkid>	well, if some parts are going to be static HTML, and some parts are going to be dynamic JS, then you have to make decisions about how to divide that up between them, but if you just make it dynamic js from HTML templates then everything's consolidated in what seems to me to be the most appropriate fashion for each of the tools involved
#stoopkid>	the python program might eventually output to another UI platform besides the browser
#koo7>	yeah yeah
#stoopkid>	idk, i'm thinking would be less work on both our parts :)
#koo7>	okay then
#stoopkid>	so, everything that's going to be displayed should be put into templates, and the js shouldn't interact with anything but this and a target div element in the static HTML
#stoopkid>	then it'll be portable and i could maybe end up using this on other things
#stoopkid>	ok, so then i would just be making a js script to compose a graph from a sequence of transitions
#stoopkid>	i'm thinking they probably already have one of those?
#koo7>	hm
#stoopkid>	i don't know what this type of format is called formally
#koo7>	depends what you want to do with it i guess
#koo7>	if i was to feed the bindings into cytoscape i would be doing addnode addedge...
#koo7>	and id think theres nothing to keeping the graph/table
#koo7>	nothing library-worthy in that itself
	#hazirafel (~hazirafel@176.106.226.239) has joined #zennet
#stoopkid>	ok, it's simple enough anyway
#stoopkid>	one thing to make sure of is that all transitions can work going both forwards and backwards from a given state
#koo7>	yeah, its just adding and removing edges
#stoopkid>	could be editing some property of an edge or node
#koo7>	since we arent feeding the data into anything else like cytoscape or ubigraph, lets just pressupose that all the nodes are already there, as they are, the parts of the kb text
#stoopkid>	not sure what you mean
#koo7>	maybe lets keep it simple, there are just two colors of arrows, succesfully bound and failed
#koo7>	ah that wasnt quite on-topic
#koo7>	i was off on my own thought train
#stoopkid>	hehe
#koo7>	anyway, i think it would be best if you dont worry about any attribute changing
#koo7>	leave that to real graph animating libs we may want to plug into later
#koo7>	but such lib will hardly draw over our divs
#koo7>	and we dont need that functionality
#koo7>	i mean over the text bits
#koo7>	hehe i already have a vision of a gorgeous animation with ubigraph:0
#koo7>	*:)
#stoopkid>	ok so, you pick a graph format and a static design/templates, and i'll make a script to make abstract graphs from this format, and a script to actually run the UI
#koo7>	sounds good

#HMC_a>	I dunno, if you genetically synthesize an artifical ("contrived") human genome, does that count as a "robot"?
#stoopkid>	probably not in an autopsy
#HMC_a>	maybe there are some "robots" around already who are not aware of their "robot" status...? :-)
#HMC_a>	i dunno, maybe not yet (but soon, if not, hehe)...
#HMC_a>	but surely we've got some such "robot" animals by now, at least ;-)
	#scippio has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
#stoopkid>	i'm pretty sure we do
#HMC_a>	for sure we have some "robot" bacteria and fungii, that's pretty well known

#stoopkid>	http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-scientists-genetically-modify-human-embryos-1.17378
#HMC_a>	dunno if we're quite to the point where I'd think it likely that we have a full synthetic human genome brought to a viable maturation...
#HMC_a>	but
#HMC_a>	I will say that if someone showed me such I wouldn't be at all *susprised* in the least by it ;-)
#nilli>	I mean come on they ask me to identify Ice cream and know that it is not a pizza. and my sight not even by taste. 
#stoopkid>	not sure why we would synthesize the whole thing rather than just modify the parts we need
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: because "why not" XD
#HMC_a>	with an entirely controlled genome there's no surprises
#stoopkid>	entirely controlled but entirely unresearched
#HMC_a>	you don't have to worry about some unexpected pathway interaction affecting viability
#stoopkid>	seems to me that most of a fully synthetic human genome would just be a copy-paste from most of the current human genome
#stoopkid>	or 'a' current human genome, i should say
#HMC_a>	ah, sure, but synthesized directly you know exactly what you're getting, and at exactly what defect rate, so you'll know exactly how much mutation to expect across trials
#HMC_a>	so for "growing people in bulk" it is probably preferrable to use such fully synthetic strands as opposed to using natural raw materials taken from cells :-)
#HMC_a>	since you can know a priori what "yield" to expect :-)
#stoopkid>	well, i want 3,000 mexicans, and 50K chinese, no defects, good working condition
#HMC_a>	haha, #zennet, probably one of the only places in the world where there is straight-faced discussion of yield impacts on human clone farming.... XD
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: hrmm, I'd think you'd want to take source materials from the most rugged geographies, no?
#nilli>	no Jews pleas, you cant get read of them
#stoopkid>	HMC_a: it's more a matter of UN-recognized nationality of the final output worker-unit
#stoopkid>	nilli: lol
#HMC_a>	maybe some sub-saharan wastelands, anywhere that has a good solid history of subsistence tribes....
#stoopkid>	did any of you watch the 3rd US republican party debate debate btw?
#stoopkid>	its funnier than dave chappelle, i've never really seen anything like it lol
#stoopkid>	it seemed like they spent a good 10 minutes just saying like "yea, we took your money, we stole it"
#nilli>	any way imagine making them all the same, it will be so wasteful of resources. this way they take care of it untill they will reach perfection. Hitler kind of got the idea he did not realize the code and he made a grave mistake 
#nilli>	but he did not ralize the code
#stoopkid>	mein Vater machte mich in der Faktory
#HMC_a>	so I'm pretty sure that unification and step counts are not being counted correctly
#koo7>	should it be successful unifications or any attempts?
#nilli>	perfection can not be achieved by eliminating those that are not perfect, but rather by using all the power they possess to  work for your goal out of free will
#koo7>	^
#HMC_a>	perfection will only be achieved by truely embracing the breadth of human imperfection...
#HMC_a>	and this, too, is why we build tau?
#HMC_a>	anyway
#HMC_a>	koo7: it should be any (non-ep, which i think you have correct there) unifications
#HMC_a>	but it should be statement level unifications, not individual term level unifications
#nilli>	[14:01] <HMC_a> perfection will only be achieved by truely embracing the breadth of human imperfection... <----exactly . I was just about to try write something like that
#HMC_a>	right now we count s/o seperately, and joins also, which is inflating the count
#HMC_a>	nilli: yes, the main thing (IMO) that keeps us from progressing toward a collective perfection is our unwillingness to stop striving for individual perfections :-)
#koo7>	well, hrm, 
#nilli>	OK guys Koo7 HMC_a great work carry on.... 
#nilli>	you see what I mean? 
#koo7>	HMC_a, you might want to try to fix that yourself, since no matter how i try i cant make myself care for making it count something just like something else which doesnt even work
#koo7>	as always youre welcome on azure
#nilli>	[14:04] <HMC_a> nilli: yes, the main thing (IMO) that keeps us from progressing toward a collective perfection is our unwillingness to stop striving for individual perfections :-) <--- I can only agree and quote

#HMC_a>	we need to "give up" and admit that individually we are these horribly flawed little things, and always will be...  :-)
#HMC_a>	this goes back to the whole everyone is "necessarily either inconsistent or arrogant" thing XD
#HMC_a>	koo7: for step count I think we want to count only on initial entry to a rule (or on a fact match)
#nilli>	but we are so unique, and how else could we be that if not for our flaws. 
#HMC_a>	right now we are counting each body statement as a step, and we actually want to be counting heads...

	#HumanistRobot (~chatzilla@181-161-39-176.baf.movistar.cl) has joined #zennet
#koo7>	HMC_a, yes on both points
#stoopkid>	koo7: essentially each host node would store a file for each page they want to offer, containing the name of that page given in some specified standard format
#koo7>	a file containing a name?
#stoopkid>	then we can use ipfs dht findprovs <hash-of-some-name>, and it'll find all the nodes hosting that file
#stoopkid>	so, they would host that file to state to the network that they have that page, in a way that everybody can find
#stoopkid>	so then, each provider would have a directory linked to their peer-id by IPNS, containing a file for each page which stores an actual ipfs link to the content
#stoopkid>	so, when you do dht findprovs <name-hash>, you'll get back a list of peer-ids
#stoopkid>	and then for each peer-id you would go to /ipns/<peer-id>/<name-hash> or /ipns/<peer-id>/name, and retrieve a file containing an actual ipfs link to some content
#stoopkid>	so, this content would essentially be an edit-history merkle DAG, like git, but applied to wiki-pages
#stoopkid>	and you would compose all these different merkle DAGs being provided into one single one that you can navigate

#HumanistRobot>	Hello, Tau
#HumanistRobot>	Dear naturalog, I've told stoopkid about "bitshares"
#HumanistRobot>	g. bitshares
#HumanistRobot>	bitshares .g
#tromp>	.g bitshares
#tau-bot>	tromp: https://bitshares.org/
#HumanistRobot>	http://wiki.bitshares.org/index.php/BitShares
	#HMC_a sighs
#HMC_a>	bitshares is like
#HMC_a>	"let's take every fundamentally flawed premise that people seem to think actually sound and put them together in one package and see what happens" XD
#stoopkid>	the economic premise seemed reasonable, idk about block-chain security premise though
#HMC_a>	fiat pegged coins - actually impossible.  dpos security - actually impossible. consistency at 100ktps and 1 second confirmation - actually impossible.  
#HMC_a>	secure pos (only) checkpointing - actually impossible.  fair bounty escrow without verification - actually impossible.  
#HMC_a>	hrmm, what did I miss?
#HMC_a>	:-)
#HMC_a>	the original implementation was far less fail-tastic. :-|
#HMC_a>	but then they decided that they needed every possible hype-generating feature, regardless of if the feature is actually possible or not....
#stoopkid>	alright, how about my proposed content finding/providing mechanism for ipfs-wiki then? :)
#stoopkid>	and ipfs in general, that one's more relevant to me than bitshares
#koo7>	what do people like about rooibos
#koo7>	i will never understand that

#koo7>	stoopkid, so the structure im going for now is: 
#koo7>	(its written to print out html, we will change that later when the structure is settled)
#koo7>	each s and o of every term is wrapped in <span class="part" id=some number>
#koo7>	if there is a list, the spans will be nested, with a second numbering level, beginning from 0 again
#koo7>	so, a command might look like: {"type":"add", "a": [5], "b":[13]}
#koo7>	5 would be top-level span with id 5
#koo7>	[5, 6] would indicate sub-span id 6 of top-level span id 5
#koo7>	later we can add more semantical structure around this
#koo7>	so the gui actually knows that some part belongs to this or that rule, or rather processess this rule by rule etc
	#pastorkoala has quit (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
#koo7>	as on the big picture, these adds and removes i think will be best conveyed in a flat list
#koo7>	with {"type":"step"} interspersed between them to indicate one step of the slider
#koo7>	and the coro info
#koo7>	and text literals for chunks of the prover debug output

#rszeno>	koo7, zero, one or many, see term rewriting and all that, page 71, where is an example for 'many': unif of x and f(y) -> { x -> f(y) } or { x -> f(a), y -> a }, ... 
#koo7>	:) we dont have functors
#rszeno>	doesn't matter
#koo7>	by two things i mean two of either var, const or list
#rszeno>	i don't follow. what mean "two or either" ?
#koo7>	im unifying two things, and each thing can be either a var or a const or a list
#koo7>	and neither of potato, functor or bicycle
#rszeno>	ok, so you can build 2^3 combinations, var - var, var - const, ....
#koo7>	yes
#rszeno>	split the combinations in two sets since unif is symmetric
#koo7>	its all coded already
#koo7>	i just started tripping a little assertion so im investigating
#rszeno>	so for var - const and const - var you just swap and check one
#koo7>	https://github.com/naturalog/tauchain/blob/univar2/univar.cpp#L863
#koo7>	its only tripping with debuglevel < 15...:)
#rszeno>	i don't have patience to follow the code
#koo7>	you dont have to
#koo7>	just saying that its written already
#rszeno>	cuzco said, "don't know, don't care, how about this?"
#rszeno>	:)
#rszeno>	is only about your question about 0 or one solutions
#koo7>	hmm
#rszeno>	you can find the answer in Baader book
#rszeno>	btw, what if you have to unify a var and a list?
#koo7>	i bind the var to it
#rszeno>	ok
#rszeno>	btw, you can see a functor as a map between two sets -> a list ( this is why i said that doesn't matter that you don't have functors )
#koo7>	hmm
#koo7>	oh im a dummy
#rszeno>	?
#koo7>	it only incs the count in a TRACE macro, so the count depends on debug level
#koo7>	mystery solved
#koo7>	hows your back?
#rszeno>	painfull, :)
#koo7>	maybe you could get some medical marijuana for that..
#rszeno>	nehh, i hate drugs
#koo7>	why?
#rszeno>	hm, second thought, actualy is a lie since i love to smoke and drink, :)
#rszeno>	it make you to lose sense of reality and control
#koo7>	you prefer the worst drugs of them all...:)
#rszeno>	maybe, we all poison ourself in different ways
#rszeno>	i have a homemade https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzuica
#rszeno>	actualy is palinka, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1linka
#rszeno>	mm,  there is a czech palinka? so you know what i mean, :)
#koo7>	yep
#koo7>	apparently its a more general term in czech, but theres https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slivovitz
#rszeno>	i don't think wikipedia is correct
#koo7>	well like it says, palit = to distill, while sliv = plum
#rszeno>	we have slivovitz too but is not as strong as palinka
#koo7>	 The usual proof of private-produced slivovice is over 50% of alcohol
#rszeno>	names come form our history, austro-hungarian empire
#rszeno>	yes, this one is over 75%
#rszeno>	the pleasure is in flavor not realy in being strong, at least for me

#rszeno>	red, doesn't worst the effort
#rszeno>	like stallone to, but is in same category, see the expandables serie
#rszeno>	s/to/too/
#koo7>	ive told you about http://www.csfd.cz/film/28910-ceremoniar/ , right?
#koo7>	yeah expendables was crap
#rszeno>	i don't know what's wrong with them, they want more money or what?
#koo7>	machete was quite good
#koo7>	maybe they just like acting?:)
#rszeno>	didn't see it
#rszeno>	acting is not enought, you need to like it what you do
#rszeno>	stallone started with a porno film, i understand, he need money
#rszeno>	later rocky and rambo series, same story, maybe, i accept this but now ? i don't know
#rszeno>	oscar is my favorite with stallone
#koo7>	err rambo, thats what i meant earlier, rambo 1
#rszeno>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_%281991_film%29
#koo7>	not many people seen that one

#adam789654123>	naturalog: you around
#adam789654123>	i know you're busy, but i wanted to say hello
#naturalog>	hi :)
#adam789654123>	:)
#naturalog>	just woke up recently
#adam789654123>	long time stranger
#adam789654123>	how are you?
#naturalog>	working hard
#adam789654123>	good morning
#adam789654123>	awsome
#naturalog>	ive never been good in smalltalk
#naturalog>	so if you come up with say some math thing
#naturalog>	better chances to catch me :)
#adam789654123>	ive been working like crazy on programming
#naturalog>	great
#adam789654123>	is that mathy enouph?
#naturalog>	haha
#adam789654123>	ive been developing a number of concepts and frameworks
#naturalog>	nice
#adam789654123>	The "recursive interupt interface", and the  "programmable user interface" are two systems ive made substantial progress on
#adam789654123>	naturalog: if you're busy, no problem. Im not sure if programming counts as math to you
#adam789654123>	to me, its mathematical so.....
#naturalog>	i didnt mean that only math is interesting to me
#adam789654123>	oh
#naturalog>	ofc whatever goes with you is also interesting
#adam789654123>	:)
#naturalog>	i just meant that i never had smalltalk skills
#naturalog>	and gave up trying long ago
#adam789654123>	me neither
#adam789654123>	but we still need some bigtalk skills?
#adam789654123>	;)
#naturalog>	right thats what i meant: big talk to me :))
#adam789654123>	so i came up with this new idea today, base on my rii framework
#adam789654123>	did i tell you about the rii framework?
#naturalog>	yes
#adam789654123>	great
#naturalog>	i didnt understand what features it gives that gdb doesnt
#naturalog>	conditional breakpoints etc also gdb can do
#naturalog>	with counts etc
#naturalog>	also the whole hw breakpoints things
#adam789654123>	the best i can offer now is that its with the given programming language
#adam789654123>	its within the given language
#naturalog>	which lang?
#adam789654123>	and its customizable in a simple way
#adam789654123>	common lisp
#naturalog>	ok well im not familiar at all with lisp tools
#naturalog>	but i guess they have their own smart debuggers (if not even gdb itself)
#adam789654123>	they have this kind of stuff, but i wanted this one to be simpler because of the kind of tool i am working on
#naturalog>	i dont understand lisp at all
#naturalog>	(i learned a few times and forgot very quickly)
#adam789654123>	its very simple actually
#adam789654123>	its deceptively simple
#naturalog>	i know
#adam789654123>	this new idea
#adam789654123>	....
#naturalog>	but i never wrote anything in lisp so it was sure ill forget it
#adam789654123>	yeah... with anythng its like that
#adam789654123>	for me
#adam789654123>	during my work with the rii, i did some heavy work with this core pattern
#adam789654123>	inter-fun calls fun calls inter-fun calls fun ....
#adam789654123>	the thing to note is that `fun' doesnt need to know its interaction with `inter-fun'
#adam789654123>	but, there are many other tools that could use such a feature
#adam789654123>	as being able to live between the frames
#adam789654123>	so my new idea has to do with chaining these together
#adam789654123>	the overview is that i make a function definer that takes as an argument intermediate-function tools to use
#adam789654123>	each of these tools has acces to functions that live between the frames
#adam789654123>	but they also dont need to know about one another
#adam789654123>	just as the function didnt need to know it was defined within rii
#adam789654123>	this making any sense so far naturalog ?
#naturalog>	i cant really tell
#naturalog>	you speak about things i cant really understand
#adam789654123>	well... hopefully i bring it together with the next bit
#naturalog>	i never encountered the needs you speak about (obviously) so i cant tell
#naturalog>	koo7 is a lisp expert btw
#adam789654123>	oh
#adam789654123>	i had no idea
#adam789654123>	thats awsome
#naturalog>	koo5 too
#naturalog>	and AndKoo[o*]
#adam789654123>	living between the frames has to do with the thinking about writing a program recursively
#adam789654123>	lets say i write a program
#adam789654123>	and this happens
#adam789654123>	fun_a calls fun_b calls fun_c returns 7
#adam789654123>	living between the frames would be to assign these functions the tools as above
#adam789654123>	so that the ACTUAL function calls are somethnig like
#adam789654123>	inter_fun calls fun_a calls inter_fun calls fun_b calls inter-fun calls fun_c returns 7
#adam789654123>	but the person who wrote the program doesnt have to know that the tools they are using are relying on functions stacked between their function calls
#adam789654123>	so I am calling it, "living between the frames"
#adam789654123>	make any sense?
#naturalog>	i guess
#naturalog>	what you want is included in dumping the state of the program in every step
#adam789654123>	but note that i havent actually left the program
#adam789654123>	i dont have to dump anything
#naturalog>	right, "included"
#adam789654123>	it can all be interactive
#naturalog>	yes, in runtime
#adam789654123>	yes
#naturalog>	so what a lisp interpreter is doing?
#adam789654123>	same thing
#naturalog>	its taking the current step and advanced to the next step, right
#naturalog>	yes
#adam789654123>	this abstracts on that
#naturalog>	so you can take any lisp state-dumper and organize its data as you wish
#adam789654123>	im working on interactive tools
#naturalog>	debuggers, interpreters, both interactive
#koo7>	flawless logic:D
#adam789654123>	but these can interact with the program that is running
#adam789654123>	hey koo7 
#adam789654123>	:D
#adam789654123>	or consider that you can use concepts from debuggers, interpreters, etc, to work on interactive enviroments
#koo7>	yo
#adam789654123>	:)
#adam789654123>	thats what this is
#adam789654123>	an interactive enviroment
#adam789654123>	eventually leading to a computer algebra system
#adam789654123>	but i am noticing all of these beautiful side projects that i just cant miss up on developing
#adam789654123>	................
#adam789654123>	mind if i talk tau a bit?
#koo7>	sure
#adam789654123>	i plan to start working on prototyping with idris
#adam789654123>	and im going to start very soon
#adam789654123>	i was wondering thoughts about having prototyping done
#adam789654123>	or interests in prototyping for the system
#adam789654123>	chirp chirp...... chirp chirp....... chirp chirp.........
#adam789654123>	not everyone at once!
#adam789654123>	one criket at a time!
#adam789654123>	:P
#koo7>	:) well..
#adam789654123>	please type a bit to share some thoughts
#adam789654123>	i b back in a sec
#koo7>	me i dont care much about anything from the blockchain integration up
#adam789654123>	you are strictly concerned with blockchain integration
#adam789654123>	ok
#koo7>	no
#adam789654123>	uhhh
#adam789654123>	sorry
#adam789654123>	what do you care about?
#koo7>	below
#adam789654123>	ohhh
#adam789654123>	what's below?
#adam789654123>	im not sure how the system is tiered
#koo7>	the prover
#adam789654123>	oh
#adam789654123>	what do you think about a simple prototype in idris?
#koo7>	of?
#adam789654123>	or a simple prototype in any language actually
#adam789654123>	great
#adam789654123>	ok
#adam789654123>	sorry
#adam789654123>	the prover
#adam789654123>	what do you think about a simple prototypes of the prover in other languages?
#adam789654123>	what do you think about simple prototypes of the prover in other languages?
#koo7>	well...
#adam789654123>	including targeting idris
#koo7>	well yeah go for it i guess
#koo7>	"prototype in idris" sounds...strange, tho
#adam789654123>	why?
#koo7>	i just think it will be a lot of work
#adam789654123>	yeah...
#adam789654123>	it will be
#adam789654123>	im sure of it
#adam789654123>	but much less work than NOT prototyping
#adam789654123>	thats the idea anyway
#adam789654123>	much less work than the actual system
#adam789654123>	well.... im off in a bit
#adam789654123>	have a good night all
#koo7>	ya  too

#naturalog>	"zero does not have a successor"
#naturalog>	^ definition of nats in forbidding (scientific) logic
#naturalog>	well ofc it has a successor, you got what i meant
#naturalog>	a successor is nonzero
#naturalog>	zero is not a successor
#naturalog>	~successors={0}
#naturalog>	equality can also be interpreted negatively as indifference
#naturalog>	zero is not different than not being a successor
#naturalog>	the strength such logic is ofc the straight forward ability to refute it if it's possible to refute it
#naturalog>	so its not constructive proofs but constructive refutation
#naturalog>	and something is being held as truth as long as no constructive refutation was found
#naturalog>	just like in physics.
#naturalog>	just like in a learning system:
#naturalog>	if you only follow rules, you don't learn ofc
#naturalog>	i.e. only rules telling you what to do
#naturalog>	but if you can do anything except rules telling you what not to do, you can learn
#naturalog>	obv vcdim is always in the back of my mind which is completely negative logic as described here (refutation based)
#naturalog>	and ofc, just like sigma algebras, rather topological spaces. aka probability measures rather homotopies
#naturalog>	in sigma algebra things can be defined by disjunction or negation
#naturalog>	indeed, a scientific theory may say "at least one of two phenomena are forbidden" (disjunction), which one might say that it does not strictly forbid one situation and hence not scientific, so the disjunction axioms comes to help because it is indeed forbid more complex situations

#nilli>	I will most likely suck at that

#nilli>	I dont need to explain anyone what I do
#koo7>	you would make a great programmer
#nilli>	I think I could , but I had to follow some rules for that, I also suck at that.
#nilli>	other then an artist I was really good as scenic artist since most of what we do is using materials in a way they were never meant to be used 
#nilli>	I guess in a way most of my art is "rule making" . that is what i am best at.  and that where I connect to the tau too.

#adam789654123>	hi naturalog
#naturalog>	hi
#adam789654123>	im behind in the stuff i wanted to get done by now, but its worth it
#adam789654123>	ill catch up soon enough
#naturalog>	what are you busy with nowadays?
#adam789654123>	still working on the CAS and related subsystems
#adam789654123>	but i keep finding new beautiful paradigms
#adam789654123>	i am expecting a VERY compact program
#naturalog>	a cas id like to have (in fact this was one of the first conversation topic i ever had with HMC_a) is,
#naturalog>	say you have "int x,y; <some code>; int z = x+y;"
#naturalog>	now x,y,z are sizeof(int)*8 bits each right
#naturalog>	addition/multiplication/bitwise and/bitwise or/etc are all binary functions on those digits
#naturalog>	id like a cas that dumps those operations
#adam789654123>	that dumps the "micro" operations?
#naturalog>	i want to have like every bitwise AND is replaced by multiplications of zeros and ones
#naturalog>	and negation is 1-x
#naturalog>	and so forth
#naturalog>	later on id like to substitute there not 0 or 1 but real numbers
#adam789654123>	well... with what im working on, that could be implemented perhaps as its own application
#adam789654123>	we can talk about the details more as you wish
#adam789654123>	this should not be difficult, i think
#naturalog>	at first id like to simply write that multivariable polynomial for addition of two n-bit numbers
#naturalog>	programatically ofc
#naturalog>	then i play with that poly in some "real" cas like maxima
#adam789654123>	yeah
#adam789654123>	i completely understand
#adam789654123>	this is interesting, and im going to save this as reference
#naturalog>	one of my latest motos is "explore the bindigits"
#adam789654123>	my idea, for starters, was an elementary cas
#naturalog>	since ~2y ago when i suddenly realized i know nothing about what addition is
#adam789654123>	great, i would *love* to develop something for mathematical exploration
#adam789654123>	i have another idea also.... 
#naturalog>	i have three more!
#adam789654123>	haha
#adam789654123>	then you go first
#naturalog>	i say we actually begin working when we get to the 1000'th idea
#adam789654123>	haha
#adam789654123>	this other idea is quite the beauty though
#adam789654123>	i think its something that could make some money also
#adam789654123>	being broke, i could use some money
#naturalog>	same here
#adam789654123>	this idea has to do with the programmable user interface im working on
#adam789654123>	i should be able to extend it to the browser without too much problem
#adam789654123>	make it a server application
#adam789654123>	if i can do that, i should be in a position to mockup prototypes *very* quickly
#adam789654123>	i think this could be a great way to get customers
#HMC_a>	naturalog: why not just use off-the-shelf logic synthesis tools to get your adder circuit? :-)
#naturalog>	:) dont know any
#adam789654123>	hello HMC_a 
#HMC_a>	like I did originally when we first started down that road
#naturalog>	heh i was sure you did it with idris
#HMC_a>	.g yosys open source synthesis
#tau-bot>	HMC_a: http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/
#naturalog>	tx
#HMC_a>	.g yosys
#tau-bot>	HMC_a: http://www.clifford.at/yosys/
#HMC_a>	.g abc synthesis
#tau-bot>	HMC_a: http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/
#naturalog>	cool
#adam789654123>	one of my ideas was that you could record user input
#naturalog>	interesting to note that all finite 0-1 strings are simply all naturals. and all finite or infinite 0-1 strings are all reals between 0 and 1. so number systems can equivalently be defined as those bit sequences
#adam789654123>	if you made an interpreter, im thinking you could record interpreter input
#HMC_a>	the idris came second and was short lived before the jump to sympy
#naturalog>	yes i remember sympy, and those synthesizers gave stuff that sympy eats?
#HMC_a>	but my original "rv expression compiler" was based on commercial equivalents to yosys/abc
#naturalog>	ic
#HMC_a>	and no, the sympy stuff was all standalone
#HMC_a>	but yosys can output smtlib ;-)
#naturalog>	nice
#HMC_a>	and (most interesting for radem rv stuffs) can build and-inverter graphs
#HMC_a>	nand logic :-)
#naturalog>	nili introduced me to someone here that is a lecturer about heavy-math dsp stuff
#naturalog>	and we were trying to think of problems to tackle together
#naturalog>	one direction is exploring the bindigits
#HMC_a>	3sat. :-|
#naturalog>	he's expert in markov chains etc
#HMC_a>	XD
#naturalog>	its all the same ofc
#naturalog>	also he really liked the idea of the agricultural robot ive been speaking about for years.. i really hope he'll do it
#HMC_a>	"we have no problems, except for politicians and 3sat" --Jamaican saying (adapted)
#naturalog>	:)
#naturalog>	thats right, i spoke a lot to him about npc
#naturalog>	and quadforms etc, and i offered expressing boolean processes as stochastic processes and see what happens
#naturalog>	so it all begins with a boolean framework
#naturalog>	the other stuff he really liked is ito-einstein
#naturalog>	so basically he's trying to pick from those :)
#naturalog>	since he's expert in tracking (kalman filter et al)
#naturalog>	he's exactly the right person to do the ito-einstein field equations with
#naturalog>	i explained to him that "my physical claim is that tracking is reality. i.e., also when a particle feels a field, all it can do is kalman filter. i claim that there is no reality beneath that, but all players act with the info they have"
#HMC_a>	particles?  bah... ;-)
#naturalog>	:)
#HMC_a>	don't fall for such illusory tricks ;-)
#naturalog>	right, and moreover:
#naturalog>	i told him we're going to work differentially but integrally
#naturalog>	no "instant" speed, but we measure speed along time
#naturalog>	integral equations, no differential equations
#naturalog>	*not to work differentialyl
#HMC_a>	heyting ftw ;-)
#naturalog>	:)
#HMC_a>	anyway
#HMC_a>	have you played with koo's branch at all yet?
#naturalog>	not yet. any quick instructions?
#HMC_a>	it is wicked fast, and so far is passing every one of the eulersharp test suite that I'd expect it to (without rpo, etc)
#naturalog>	cool
#naturalog>	how fast comparing to tau in release build?
#HMC_a>	beats it on the big tests (adder, cnfs, etc)...
#naturalog>	great
#naturalog>	adder long version 8sec in tau right
#naturalog>	release build, correctly
#HMC_a>	and there's still room to improve ;-)
#naturalog>	sure, p.cpp is doing it in 4sec
#naturalog>	also do they do the same number of frames? for the sake of comparison
#naturalog>	anyway i also see how what im working on now is going to be maybe x10 times faster than p.cpp, maybe even much more on big work
#HMC_a>	~7sec in tau, <0.5sec in tau.yield...
#naturalog>	great
#naturalog>	what's the cmdline?
#HMC_a>	wrt frame count, well.....
#naturalog>	ah well on adder it outputs like 2048 proofs isnt it
#HMC_a>	it is neither displaying correctly, nor actually correct, hehe
#naturalog>	but is it designed to be exactly the same?
#HMC_a>	"should be" ;-)
#naturalog>	good
#HMC_a>	cmdline is compatible w/ tau.interp
#naturalog>	on master?
#naturalog>	wasnt it changed there?
#HMC_a>	so `./tau < some_older_example` generally works as expected
#naturalog>	ok
#naturalog>	ok great i'll study the code very well
#naturalog>	cant promise to finish tonight but i will
#koo7>	have fun, ha ha
#HMC_a>	it still has some ways to go... there are still some unnecessary indirection overheads at runtime, for example, but... it works and is pretty fast, now, hehe
#HMC_a>	it's still no cryptominisat or anything, heh
#HMC_a>	but it performs well enough that I'm now pretty excited to see if a full native emit can "get there" on performance, heh
#HMC_a>	and, most importantly, it is surviving testing so far XD
#naturalog>	yes thats definitely an achievement
#HMC_a>	if it does pass all of the euler 'etc' tests that ot should then I'll try taking the fuzzer to it
#naturalog>	how did you test cnf?
#HMC_a>	but that is still a bit painful, as any time i try it just floods me with parser problems, hehe
#naturalog>	i wrote a stateless parser in c
#naturalog>	one (max two) chars at a time
#HMC_a>	what i'd really like is to not have to hand-massage each test's syntax, heh
#HMC_a>	it'd be great if we could just take all of the euler .n3 files as is
#koo7>	HMC_a, did you try with marpa?
#HMC_a>	no
#HMC_a>	should I?  How do I?
#koo7>	err well first you build marpa
#koo7>		git submodule init
#koo7>		git submodule update
#koo7>		cd libmarpa;	make dist;	cd dist;	./configure;	make
#koo7>	then maybe make with_marpa still works

#koo7>	HMC_a, please dont write buggy tests anymore
#koo7>	what would you prefer that i focus on now, builtins or fixing the cli?
	#adam789654123 holds back his smartass comment
#koo7>	everything?:)
#koo7>	if builtins, some specs would be useful
#koo7>	adam789654123, im open to suggestions:)
#adam789654123>	talk to me? about a theoretical prototype implemetation?
#adam789654123>	that is what *I* want you to do
#adam789654123>	which of course is why you should want to do it
#adam789654123>	:P
#koo7>	as on that, from the last time you brought it up i understood that you would want to prototype the reasoner algo itself...which doesnt make sense to me, since it seems i already have the real thing
#adam789654123>	well, it has to do with theoretical work and organization
#stoopkid>	in idris tho
#adam789654123>	but its not to step on your toes or undermine the great work you are doing
#adam789654123>	its for *us* to learn from, and to teach with
#koo7>	thats cool, i just mean..lets call it an implementation, not a prototype?
#koo7>	or a prototype of an implementation i guess
#adam789654123>	i see
#stoopkid>	maybe would be better to do thorough documentation on this implementation and making some learning resources that we can use when we want to make other implementations
#adam789654123>	because you made it first, so why is it a "proto-type" or "first" implementation
#koo7>	i understand prototype as "proof of concept"
#koo7>	aaanyway
#koo7>	yeah i think stoopkid has a point
#adam789654123>	stoopkid: yeah... i think that is what we have to do anyway
#adam789654123>	stoopkid: or at least get a solid theoretical grounding
#koo7>	theres not much i can say now about an idris or haskell implementation, i have no idea how one would go about it
#adam789654123>	stoopkid: which will require organizing documents
#adam789654123>	it doesnt matter to me koo7 
#adam789654123>	do the concepts make sense to me?
#adam789654123>	to i understand how they go together?
#adam789654123>	then implementation within a specific paradigm is can be the next step
#adam789654123>	that is just going to be how this is going to work out
#koo7>	this just requires us three getting on azure and going over the code
#adam789654123>	what is azure?
#koo7>	i just have to warn you...theres a lot of ifdefs
#koo7>	our vps
#stoopkid>	koo7: wrt idris/haskell i would start with the theoretical and do more direct translation into type theory
#adam789654123>	well, i need the general picture
#adam789654123>	when i get the general picture, i want to make a crappy implementation
#adam789654123>	then i want to make it better
#adam789654123>	then better
#adam789654123>	etc...
#adam789654123>	but with a smaller codebase, this is a reasonable approach
#adam789654123>	i want to get to some beautiful core ideas beautifully implemented
#adam789654123>	that is the "gold standard" for me
#adam789654123>	this can serve for experimentation and pedagogy
#adam789654123>	as well as to spread the word
#adam789654123>	about this bigger thing we are working on
#adam789654123>	consider that this could potentially be a gateway tool to funnel people into the project
#adam789654123>	that could be interested in many levels of implementation simultaneously
#koo7>	well, its also true that my branch is "just yieldprolog in c++"
#adam789654123>	which is what we need, i think, to get this of the ground
#adam789654123>	cool
#adam789654123>	there is only so much that we can do as a small group
#adam789654123>	the prototype could serve as an organizational tool
#adam789654123>	or "prototype"
#adam789654123>	as well as organized documentation
#adam789654123>	or a system of organizing relevant documentation
#koo7>	hrm
#adam789654123>	thats the main value i see from it
#adam789654123>	its like a partial blueprint that we can actually run and edit
#stoopkid>	yea, i've already started practicing how to express my notes in tau-lang
#koo7>	:)
#adam789654123>	fyi, im excited about this project
#adam789654123>	its something that i think about
#adam789654123>	what i understand about it, its brilliant, AND brilliantly simple
#adam789654123>	and its worth getting excited about
#adam789654123>	once we get something that sort of works, that will be *hugely* motivating
#adam789654123>	because i believe in this project
#adam789654123>	i believe it will catchon
#adam789654123>	i think its a *great* idea
#stoopkid>	we have something that sort of works, at least the reasoner part of it
#adam789654123>	we need to get people to play around with it in an interactive way
#adam789654123>	to imagine its potential
#adam789654123>	once we get that, we open the flood gates
#stoopkid>	like, on a decentralized wikipedia
#adam789654123>	thats what i think
#koo7>	i guess you really want to get familiar with the original yieldprolog rather then with my implementation
#koo7>	so, just read the tutorial of that, its not as long as it looks
#koo7>	stoopkid understands it well already, so he can help you along
#adam789654123>	is yieldprolog different than prologue?
#koo7>	than prolog?
#koo7>	yes
#adam789654123>	yes
#adam789654123>	sorry, misspelled
#adam789654123>	alot different?
#koo7>	define alot:)
#adam789654123>	ok
#koo7>	btw...this visualization thing i built is quite neat...
#adam789654123>	how does it work?
#adam789654123>	http://yieldprolog.sourceforge.net/
#adam789654123>	i guess thats yeildprolog
#koo7>	yes
#adam789654123>	" Yield Prolog lets you embed Prolog programs directly in Python, C# [1] or Javascript [2] by using the yield keyword."
#adam789654123>	but you say its very different
#adam789654123>	which is interesting
#adam789654123>	but i guess it depends on your sensitivity level
#adam789654123>	ive never used prolog, so.....
#adam789654123>	similar would seem damn near exact probably
#stoopkid>	you basically use the yield thing to make another programming lang be able to operate like prolog
#adam789654123>	ahhh.....
#adam789654123>	so understanding generic prolog would be helpful
#adam789654123>	www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/331/resources/lisp/onLisp/24prolog.pdf
#adam789654123>	im not sure if thats correct, because i dont have the pdf reader
#adam789654123>	www.asahi-net.or.jp/~kc7k-nd/onlispjhtml/prolog.html
#adam789654123>	that should be the correct document im looking for
#adam789654123>	they might be the same though
#koo7>	As you can see, the flow of the code in Yield Prolog is similar to Prolog. The Tutorial explains how these examples work, without expecting you to know Prolog
#stoopkid>	koo7: btw builtins, rdfs, p63, type-checker is next from here, afaik
#koo7>	seems so
#koo7>	i guess i could start implementing rdfs without needing any more guidance from hmc
#stoopkid>	what i'm curious about is making simple ways for people to coordinate knowledge-bases they build, when the environment now allows for 'execution' of those knowledge-bases & not just viewing
#koo7>	i agree with him that having some normal builtins like math, list, string manipulation would make testing easier, but for that i need to know what reasoner we want to emulate:)
	#scippio has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
#adam789654123>	stoopkid: could knowledge-base a simply call upon knowledge-base b?
#adam789654123>	as if, say, an external database query?
#stoopkid>	yes
#adam789654123>	is that a simple way for people to coordinate knowledge bases do you think?
#stoopkid>	well, it seems like the basic required feature
#adam789654123>	beyond that, a more extensive commitment might be to incorporate that knowledge base
#adam789654123>	to internalize it?
#stoopkid>	what do you mean?
#adam789654123>	to actually be a node or a carrier of that knowledge base
#adam789654123>	which might be a great idea when one has commited enough query
#adam789654123>	as more nodes stabalizes that knowledge base
#adam789654123>	for example, lets say you have module of the atlas-project knowledge base
#adam789654123>	and my knowledge bases uses your knowledge base in a hundred queries
#adam789654123>	or one of your modules or some such in a hundred queries
#adam789654123>	becomming a carrier stabalizes the knowledge base that is used in my app
#adam789654123>	does that make any sense stoopkid?
#stoopkid>	indeed
#adam789654123>	so its a way to "spread" knowledge bases
#adam789654123>	or have them live in a sink or swim enviroment
#adam789654123>	which is good because its a way to evolve useful and robust knowledge bases
#stoopkid>	so, how do users know what they're getting though when knowledge-bases are just accessing each other arbitrarily
#adam789654123>	because its giving you the results that you need, i guess
#adam789654123>	for example, atlas project could have knowledge that is useful for my project X
#adam789654123>	and if project X begins to lean heavily on Atlas, it should become a carrier to stabalize that knowledge base
#adam789654123>	as it is the dynamics of Atlas that allowing for my access to certain information
#adam789654123>	so its sort of like, a vote for Atlas

#adam789654123>	im still terminal
#adam789654123>	:P
#adam789654123>	but i got the link
#stoopkid>	well, i was thinking like, the user should probably be able to see where things are going to be coming from before they execute, and ensure that they don't execute anything not from these sources they've reviewed
#adam789654123>	that becomes impossible as the project becomes bigger
#stoopkid>	?
#adam789654123>	insofar as the source of each component cant be kept track of
#adam789654123>	by an individual
#adam789654123>	yet each compontent should be referencable
#stoopkid>	well, sure, that's what i mean about how to coordinate
#adam789654123>	but for example, do you read the linux kernel before firing up linux?
#adam789654123>	or read every program upgrade before upgrading?
#adam789654123>	etc.?
#stoopkid>	no, that's what i mean

#adam789654123>	ok
#koo7>	this is the whole provability thing in tau
#adam789654123>	ah... right
#adam789654123>	this part was beyond me
#stoopkid>	back, yea we want to be able to easily state our requirements and then formally verify that what we execute will meet those requirements

#grizzle>	question for Ohad, can we be able to buy Agoras tokens on OpenLedger once MasterXchange goes down for good? Is there a plan?
#naturalog>	hi
#naturalog>	didnt hear of openledger, looking
#grizzle>	hi again
#naturalog>	bittrex is adding us in the next days
#grizzle>	oh, well its Bitshares 2.0, they have a feature
#naturalog>	also polonies gave positive answer
#grizzle>	called user issued assets
#grizzle>	Bitshares 2.0 is decentralized, no risk of it shutting down
#naturalog>	ok but that wont support omni coins i guess
#grizzle>	oh, yeah it wont
#naturalog>	omni is "even more decentralized" than bitshares
#naturalog>	omni is all on the bitcoin blockchain
#grizzle>	right but does Omni work?
#naturalog>	ofc
#naturalog>	its just like xcp
#naturalog>	omni is mastercoin, changed their name
#grizzle>	can we buy Agoras through it? Some instructions on that would be great
#naturalog>	so better say xcp is just like omni
#naturalog>	ah the omni exchange you mean, no its not ready yet
#grizzle>	how is the project? I heard your interview
#grizzle>	and shared it
#naturalog>	tx
#naturalog>	we're making progress, still in the long and hard way
#naturalog>	i mean not "way" but "parts"
#grizzle>	ah ok, interesting point in the interview, you said its possible to run Bitcoin on Tau? Could Bitcoin be ported to Tau?
#naturalog>	sure
#grizzle>	that is a compelling use case, could be a game changer
#grizzle>	thanks for answering my questions, i will not distract you anymore from your work
#naturalog>	haha my pleasure
#naturalog>	im trying to think how people can enjoy risk free interest using two currencies
#naturalog>	i.e. btc and agoras
#naturalog>	it is possible due to black and scholes model
#naturalog>	even without b&s, just the common sense of hedging

#HMC_a>	koo7: you mean if one queries "?x a rdf:Resource" should they get every known subject as a result?
#HMC_a>	the answer would be yes. :-)
	#nilli (6dbab769@gateway/web/freenode/ip.109.186.183.105) has joined #zennet
#nilli>	 hi
#nilli>	HMC what did you think of the LTB interview with Ohad?
#nilli>	 HMC_a not hmc
#HMC_a>	the first half was excellent
#HMC_a>	the second half shouldve been edited down more.  Listening to people talk about code verbally is quite uninteresting XD
#nilli>	well it is interesting for people who really dont know and want to understand a bit more
#koo7>	HMC_a, every known subject and object, right?
#nilli>	its not exactly what is expected on LTB but its ok I think
#koo7>	or....every nodeid in the kb thats not in the pred position...where do we draw the line?
#HMC_a>	well, when i say "known subject" i don't really mean everything in the subject position, i mean every node useable as a subject (non-literal)
#koo7>	ok
#koo7>	what do you mean non-literal?
#HMC_a>	you wouldn't bind each int as a result, for example
#HMC_a>	if you returned "0 a Resource" "1 a Resource" "2 a Resource"..... this would be a bit of a problem ;-)
#koo7>	yeah, so everything that explicitly appears in the kb
#koo7>	traverse lists too
#HMC_a>	yes remember that lists are logically just triples as well...
#koo7>	err well wouldnt that mean the bnodes that rdf lists are made up of?
#HMC_a>	so any node name that appears within a list is in the object position of some rdf:first triple
#HMC_a>	yes, the bnode names as well
#nilli>	HMC_a can you give me your IRC channel full link?
#koo7>	ok, i guess i will put this builtin aside for some time
#HMC_a>	nilli: not sure what you ask
#HMC_a>	koo7: yes the "?foo a rdf:Resource" question is a bit rough... many reasoners even just omit it (and often a few other rdfs details, like subprop) from their closure
#koo7>	nilli, like, https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#zennet ?
#nilli>	HMC_a do you have a channel that is like a private, not a public one?
#nilli>	koo7 I dont know< im trying to understand how you can talk on the irc with someone 
#HMC_a>	no, I mostly tend toward public discourse ;-)
#HMC_a>	but feel free to create a new channel
#HMC_a>	they are free XD
#HMC_a>	nilli: think of a channel name as being like a hashtag on twitter...
#HMC_a>	indeed this is exactly where hashtags came from in the first place :-)
#nilli>	I see, I had a show on hashtag on twitter
#HMC_a>	so you can just make up whatever channel you want and "/join #somenewchannelname" and there it is
#nilli>	it was really fun
#nilli>	I invited my flolowers
#HMC_a>	then you just need to find some other people who will "/join #somenewchannelname" to talk to :-)
#nilli>	and dressed up for my profile picture
#nilli>	used my kids costumes 
#nilli>	and posted my pieces on the hashtag for two hours
#nilli>	back in 2009
#nilli>	was to much ahead of it s time
#nilli>	still is
#HMC_a>	koo7: for the moment I'm less concerned about getting rdfs going and more interested in facilities like log:outputString and math:sum and etc
#HMC_a>	really even just those two would be enough to get some useful results out of the fuzzer, lol :-)
#koo7>	HMC_a, i cant get too far without you being specific/providing some specs
#HMC_a>	well
#koo7>	so far all your input was "like in master"
#HMC_a>	http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/CwmBuiltins <-- "not quite specs" XD
#koo7>	Dump :s to stdout ordered by :k whereever { :k log:outputString :s }
#HMC_a>	so math:* and string:* should be pretty straightforward, list:* nearly so... 
#koo7>	so this means it waits until the query is done?
#HMC_a>	yes, it caches up the output strings until the end
#koo7>	ok
#koo7>	as on list, list:append seems a misnomer
#HMC_a>	then sorts them by subject
#HMC_a>	then prints
#HMC_a>	koo7: you mean it is more aptly called "concat"? ;-)
#koo7>	yeah something like that
#HMC_a>	I don't think you're the first to mention it, hehe
	#HMC_a shrugs
#koo7>	alright
#koo7>	its fully namespaced, after all
#nilli>	I used the link koo7 gave me and changed the name but its going on #zennet. anyway never mind  
#nilli>	ill just sit in the dark
#HMC_a>	sure, and I'm not against doubling up on some builtins later... maybe in the end we have list:append, tau:append, and tau:concat, with tau:append taking just a subject of a pair list of a list and a literal and doing an actual "append" and the other two both being "concat"... 
#HMC_a>	but we want list:append to be there and to match cwm, in any case, so that any existing logic "out there" that calls upon cwm's list:append will do the right thing
#HMC_a>	;-)
#koo7>	cool
#HMC_a>	not that there is a ton of such existing logic "out there" today to be concerned about or anything, so it is really mostly just a matter of fitting a user "expectation"
#HMC_a>	follow?
#HMC_a>	nilli: changing the zennet in the url should work fine
#HMC_a>	anyway

#naturalog>	"Dear Ohad,
#naturalog>	I had just listened to the interview you gave to Matthew Zipkin at Let's Talk Bitcoin. Your endeavor inspires me, and at the same time looks very challenging, in fact far more challenging than the Ethereum project.
#naturalog>	This is why I'd like to contribute to tauchains with programming. As per possible relevance of my experience, I have designed and developed an n-way indexed persistent storage, several language interpreters, also I had been designing a inference system working out from triple store represented data. I have significant C++ experience that doesn't include C++11 and above.

#naturalog>	Dear Peter,
#naturalog>	Thanks a lot for your support!
#naturalog>	Your experience sounds very relevant for our project, yet of course since we're on quite an advanced stage (in fact not so far from finishing), the learning curve is significant. The dev discussions are taking place on #zennet at freenode. Maybe let's talk there?
#naturalog>	Thanks again!
#naturalog>	Ohad.
#HMC_a>	koo7: generally builtins will only bind their objects, not enumerate subjects
#HMC_a>	so how you did math:sum is correct
#HMC_a>	there are a few builtins that will bind either, but they are explicitly noted as such on that cwm page
#HMC_a>	naturalog: yah, sounds like he might have some good contributions to bring :-)
#HMC_a>	koo7: some of the builtins don't bind either, the comparison operations for example, they just either match literals or fail
#HMC_a>	as a rule of thumb, think of these all as primitive data operations, not defining full theory...
#HMC_a>	so math:sum doesn't actually define sums (in the sense that it would give all combinations of sums for an object, for example)
#HMC_a>	that sort of definitional logic actually defining summation would live above the typesystem
#HMC_a>	this is just a low level native integer operation :-)

#adam789654123>	is a pipe in unix just a file?

#adam789654123>	hmmm...
#koo7>	"file descriptor"
#gpeti>	technically a file
#adam789654123>	i was hopeing for something like, checking if the file had contents for the read

#adam789654123>	sounds fun :/
#adam789654123>	well... ill keep reading
#naturalog>	koo7: gpeti: what seems to be wrong at socrates on master?
#koo7>	to check if something has something you could read without blocking, you want to either use select or see if you can do a nonblocking read somehow
#naturalog>	gpeti: on master you also have p.cpp, a self-contained interpreter and reasoner, same algo as main project
#naturalog>	s/interpreter/passer
#naturalog>	parser
#adam789654123>	well, i have #'listen, which can see if there is input on the stream
#adam789654123>	which basically returns true of false
#adam789654123>	but i still have to make the stream
#naturalog>	the main project is an interpreter. we're now working on a compiler. koo7 is implementing one design and i implement another one (based on persistent datastructs btw), afterwards we either pick the fastet or combine methods

#naturalog>	euler doesnt include interpreter and includes several bugs which all fixed in tau except one

#adam789654123>	this might be kind of primitive, but im wondering, what if i just create a file, open an input stream, and then check for data in the file?

#adam789654123>	i like this idea. its primitive and it will work
#adam789654123>	as a non-blocking read, that is

#adam789654123>	before setting that up

#adam789654123>	so i have a simple idea for now

#adam789654123>	$ echo 'something' >> file  
#adam789654123>	will append text to the end of the file

#adam789654123>	;)
#adam789654123>	echo 'gooey dooey' >> server2
#adam789654123>	then the server prints "gooey dooey"
#naturalog>	yeah thats magical
#adam789654123>	haha
#naturalog>	the magic of tcpip
#adam789654123>	im looking forward to getting into sockets
#naturalog>	are you a netcat master already?
#adam789654123>	the server is just looking in the file for new input
#adam789654123>	since its multithreaded, it could also be handling tcp/ip connections
#adam789654123>	theoretically
#adam789654123>	the multi-threaded part is less than 40 lines of code
#adam789654123>	setting up the character reader and running it as a server, less than 20 more lines of code
#adam789654123>	the biggest problem so far is that i need some kind of inbuild error handling mechanism
#adam789654123>	as it is, if i get an error, the whole thing shuts down

#amiller_>	lol thats more than i know
#naturalog>	:)
#naturalog>	i wonder why, if its all about automorphism groups, i still cant see anything about galois group and its solvability

#adam789654123>	hello zennet
#gpeti_>	hello guys! naturalog hinted yesterday that a jump starter discussion I could participate in. I am here scanning the channel for when that becomes possible, while I am following some online course
#adam789654123>	hey gpeti_ 
#adam789654123>	i have ideas that might be relevant to what you are thinking about
#gpeti_>	you must be reading my mind!
#gpeti_>	tell me!
#adam789654123>	well... maybe im off base... this has to do with the development of tau
#gpeti_>	ok that is it
#adam789654123>	or bulding a community with technical knowledge concerning the system
#gpeti_>	please share them with me
#adam789654123>	what about a storage of technical papers and information concerning the project along with meta-data about the relevance or importance of the material?
#adam789654123>	thats a starting point i think
#gpeti_>	I'm listening
#adam789654123>	i was thinking something like an academy
#adam789654123>	with access to organized information and mentoring, or at least, collaberative help
#gpeti_>	that was nice Adam!
#adam789654123>	cool
#adam789654123>	:)
#naturalog>	:) btw all avail tau materials are listed compactly on tauchain.org
#adam789654123>	great
#adam789654123>	and hi naturalog 
#adam789654123>	:)
#naturalog>	hi
#adam789654123>	you know much about computer architecture?
#gpeti_>	I'm not sure on what scale did you mean
#adam789654123>	i was wondering about what a computer does when it is.... "doing nothing"
#adam789654123>	or when it is "waiting"
#naturalog>	.g cpu interrupt
#tau-bot>	naturalog: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt
#gpeti_>	look in the last nineteen years I spent ten with real-time embedded dev
#naturalog>	cool :)
#adam789654123>	naturalog: yea, that was exactly what i was looking for
#naturalog>	cool ii :)
#naturalog>	gpeti_: so youre in industry since 1996, same like me (1995)
#gpeti_>	but actually that is not my favorite area
#adam789654123>	specifically, i was fishing for the difference between how my program is operating and how hardware operates
#adam789654123>	"polling" vs. "interupts" pins it down
#adam789654123>	i poll, and the hardware interupts
#naturalog>	gpeti_: so what are your favorites?
	#Quanttek has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
#gpeti_>	interrupts is device driver level in real-time apps. app level is handling signals
#gpeti_>	I'm programming in c since 1985
#naturalog>	haha cool on 1985 i think i knew only logo
#naturalog>	(being born in 1980)
#adam789654123>	yeah... im fine with the sampling.... i guess, as a techincal note, even the cpu samples as per the clock?
#adam789654123>	i guess that doesnt have to be the case though
#gpeti_>	programming in work
#gpeti_>	1963
#adam789654123>	1979
#adam789654123>	im thinking about making a client in c
#adam789654123>	for this thing im buiding
#adam789654123>	something that runs in a terminal
#adam789654123>	ive avoided using named pipes thus far, but that is the next step i think
#adam789654123>	named pipes, then onto sockes
#adam789654123>	(then next client step)
#gpeti_>	what are you actually doing?
#naturalog>	adam is one of the world's greatest thinkers
#adam789654123>	:P
#naturalog>	why not
#adam789654123>	sure
#adam789654123>	who not
#adam789654123>	because.... its ridiculous
#adam789654123>	thats why
#adam789654123>	:P
#adam789654123>	so far, its a framework that divids one kernel thread into n application threads 
#adam789654123>	and ive written some simple stuff with it, just to test it out
#adam789654123>	so ive made a client that can send it letters from the terminal
#adam789654123>	and the server just prints the letters sent by the client
#adam789654123>	into its own screen
#adam789654123>	note that it could have 20 clients hooked up to it, each connected on a different stream
#adam789654123>	and also have programs running simultaneously
#adam789654123>	now im musing about the scheduler
#adam789654123>	and i like my ideas, but i have to think about them further
#adam789654123>	there are technical details, but i dont want to fill the screen with my text exclusively
#gpeti_>	my favorite areas are organizing information for resilience against changed requirements and for speed

#gpeti_>	why
#adam789654123>	so i can understand
#adam789654123>	:)
#gpeti_>	which part
#adam789654123>	one is speed opmimization?
#gpeti_>	;)
#adam789654123>	the other is more abstract
#adam789654123>	which is interesting
#adam789654123>	any specific kinds of inforamation?
#adam789654123>	or.....
#adam789654123>	formatting?
#adam789654123>	information formatting?
#adam789654123>	so that it can be interpreted by various systems?
#gpeti_>	this is the point that I hate to talk about because it might put me in the wrong light
#adam789654123>	uh oh
#adam789654123>	do go on
#adam789654123>	;)
#adam789654123>	(if its ok with you of course)
#gpeti_>	for quite many years I have been designing a system similar to what you are doing
#adam789654123>	interesting
#gpeti_>	and it still doesn't run
#adam789654123>	ok
#adam789654123>	ic
#adam789654123>	well then, you're in the perfect place i would think
#adam789654123>	on a more abstract level, we want to make such systems run
#gpeti_>	but in contrast to your project I was alone
#adam789654123>	well... that makes you an expert of sorts then, no?
#gpeti_>	so what I have now is some description of the high level logic
#adam789654123>	what have you come up with?
#gpeti_>	and a database system that could support it from below
#adam789654123>	well... i want to do work with prototyping...
#gpeti_>	things for the rules of subject-private-object together with built in things
#adam789654123>	im not up to that stage yet, but maybe you would be interested
#gpeti_>	ROLES not rules
#adam789654123>	im thinking about that
#adam789654123>	thats a bit tricky
#gpeti_>	and generic universal logic primitives
#adam789654123>	that i think i can basically get
#adam789654123>	are you interested in prototype work, by any chance?
#adam789654123>	you just seem the perfect fit, so i cant help myself but press the question
#adam789654123>	;)
#gpeti_>	at this point I wouldn't rule out anything
#adam789654123>	ok
#adam789654123>	if you can think in that direction, i think it would be helpful to make something that works
#adam789654123>	and you dont have to go at it alone
#gpeti_>	I hope this was not yet the description what you want from me
#adam789654123>	no
#adam789654123>	thats just me trying to sell you something?
#adam789654123>	:P
#adam789654123>	do you have any specific aspirations?
#gpeti_>	I think I told that already
#adam789654123>	to yet your system working?
#adam789654123>	or to collaberate?
#gpeti_>	ok
#gpeti_>	the point is:
#gpeti_>	I don't think it is an optional way to achieve this goal alone
#adam789654123>	i agree
#gpeti_>	and you guys actually got further with the inference logic
#gpeti_>	so it's best if I contribute with what I can
#naturalog>	adam, to avoid confusion with newcomers you should make it clear it has nothing to do with tau :)
#adam789654123>	yeah... sorry
#naturalog>	thats why i try to avoid constant discussions about other projects
#adam789654123>	its not tau... anyway
#adam789654123>	it does have something to do with it
#adam789654123>	but we cleared that up pretty quickly
#adam789654123>	i think
#adam789654123>	:)
#naturalog>	yes np
#gpeti_>	somehow I missed that
#naturalog>	this chan is more than dev
#adam789654123>	that you didnt confuse.... that what i want to work on with what the system is
#naturalog>	adam is a dear friend here
#adam789654123>	they are different things
#adam789654123>	i want to work on prototyping for the system
#adam789654123>	but it is not the system
#naturalog>	adam789654123: did you listen to the 'lets talk bitcoin' show about tau?
#adam789654123>	no
#naturalog>	or still in terminal condition?
#adam789654123>	i can convert to mp3 though
#adam789654123>	but yea
#gpeti_>	that is how I ended up here
#naturalog>	ah its downloadable as mp3

#adam789654123>	amazingly, youtube-dl is grabbing me a file

#naturalog>	haha
#naturalog>	cool
#adam789654123>	haha
#adam789654123>	beat me to it
#adam789654123>	i could have tried clive, but i forgot the name
#naturalog>	youtube-dl is indeed an amazing tool
#adam789654123>	yeah
#naturalog>	works for so much beyond youtube
#adam789654123>	im suprized
#naturalog>	in fact i just encountered a youtube video that is banned in my country
#naturalog>	im thinking of how to dl it
#adam789654123>	it grabed the mp3
#naturalog>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hfJT9l2Mrw
#adam789654123>	wow
#adam789654123>	im wondering if i can use that to get restricted videos
#naturalog>	im not about conspiracy theory but for long im interested in the history of frankism et al
#adam789654123>	id have to look it up
#adam789654123>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankism
#naturalog>	the vast info is barely known. only gershom scholem began revealing it
#adam789654123>	and what tickles your fancy about it?
#adam789654123>	i havent gotten to the conspiracy part yet
#naturalog>	for years i claim that zionism has evil frankist (and sabbatianists) roots
#naturalog>	but apparently many others think so
#adam789654123>	hmm...
#adam789654123>	is zionism synonymous with jewish nationalism?
#naturalog>	welll
#naturalog>	there is no jewish nationalism
#naturalog>	its an oxymoron
#naturalog>	i.e. judaism is against nationalism
#naturalog>	against jewish nationalism
#naturalog>	the zionists came up with this idea 150 years ago
#adam789654123>	ic
#adam789654123>	hmmm... thats interesting
#naturalog>	most of the religious jews worldwide are nonzionists
#naturalog>	they fully admit that
#adam789654123>	i see
#naturalog>	and some of the secular jews are also nonzionists, like me
#naturalog>	but we're extremely rare here in israel
#adam789654123>	too close to the iron fist?
#naturalog>	israelis dont even know that zionism isnt part of judaism
#naturalog>	i.e. secular israelis that went through the system's brainwashing
#adam789654123>	its an interesting mix, no doubt
#adam789654123>	considering that the people brought up into the system dont have to belong to a specific ideology or religion, etc
#gpeti_>	naturalog: yesterday you hinted on a possible jumpstarting discussion with me
#adam789654123>	gpeti_: this is interesting to me also
#naturalog>	gpeti_: i dont remember whether i meant for something specific, but its always a good time
#naturalog>	so are you familiar with backtracking?
#naturalog>	at the sense of autoprovers?
#gpeti_>	Adam:I recall you rather suggested academy for me. interesting...
#gpeti_>	I wrote back tracking algo in 1989
	#scippio has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
#adam789654123>	gpeti_: i think its a good general tool that could benefit such a project as this perfectly
#adam789654123>	because it does require alot of heavy lifting and coordination
#adam789654123>	because this project requires alot of coordination and heavy lifting
#adam789654123>	even if it is ever "complete" (software is never complete), it will still require very knowlegable users
#naturalog>	gpeti_: ok first in general if there's something specific you'd like to do in tau, then it's first priority. otherwise i can think of ideas, for example, implementing the backtracking&unification persistent arrays/union-find based design
#naturalog>	in general tau is nothing but backtracking over triples
#naturalog>	and we want to make it as optimized as possible, and, compiled
#naturalog>	it must be a compiler rather interpreter before genesis
#naturalog>	because the flow is hashed for the sake of proof of execution
#naturalog>	so the flow must be prescribed at genesis
#naturalog>	given robust enough inferencer (as we plan) we can implement the typesystem simply as additional rulees
#naturalog>	rules
#koo7>	naturalog, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw1gocZyn8o , whats the word that sounds like "akabai"?
#koo7>	sammy akabai
#naturalog>	koo7: listening
#naturalog>	gpeti_: how familiar are you with haskell?
#naturalog>	ah sami hakabai
#gpeti_>	could you elaborate on "compiled backtracking"
#naturalog>	sammy is a name
#naturalog>	ha=the
#naturalog>	kabai=fireman
#naturalog>	or literally "a man to shuts fire down"
#naturalog>	*who
#naturalog>	gpeti_: so ofc there is no prescribed design built-in in the problem itself, but we have to come up with one. nevertheless there are some rigid guidelines:
#naturalog>	we know that the backtracking process generates a proof tree
#naturalog>	and every junction on the tree is some jump from premise to conclusions or from conclusion to premises
#naturalog>	aka head (conclusion) and body (premise)
#naturalog>	now, as a req in tau, we want the traversal to be breadth first
#naturalog>	tau always retrieve all results, and since it's breadth first, the results with the shortest proofs will occur first
#naturalog>	so every junction is what we call a "frame"
#naturalog>	which is like euler.js' "queue"
#naturalog>	the rules (heads and bodies) are all prescribed in the kb and query
#naturalog>	so all transitions can be written as closed (compiled) functions
#naturalog>	one design is the LogicT paper
#naturalog>	where's the link
#naturalog>	http://okmij.org/ftp/papers/LogicT.pdf
#naturalog>	that's the design HMC_a is voting for and recently implemented by koo7 
#naturalog>	i suspect that approaches as in https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ftp/publis/puf-wml07.pdf can inherently be faster, maybe without contradicting the LogicT approach (i.e. maybe those approached can be combined)
#naturalog>	that latter paper isnt a design of full backtracking algo, but it mentiones it, and to see more how unification is essentially about union-find (equivalence classes), you can see for example here http://www.cs.bu.edu/~snyder/publications/UnifChapter.pdf or more briefly at the dragon book
#naturalog>	nevertheless i do have a design for tau based on equivalence classes which for now i happen to believe is faster than "naive" O(N^2) unification algos
#naturalog>	also recall that on the backtracking tree, we dont change nodes, just mutate them, which gives rise to the use of persistent datastructs
#koo7>	thanks naturalog 
#koo7>	i dont see how yp is breadth-first, tho
#naturalog>	me neither
#gpeti_>	why the mutation
#naturalog>	the substitution
#naturalog>	as you go deep the tree, substs only grow
#gpeti_>	so this is all about working data
#naturalog>	working data?
#gpeti_>	than why make that persistent
#naturalog>	persistence in cs has dual meaning
#gpeti_>	work-space
#gpeti_>	temporal use
#naturalog>	at this scope, by persistent datastruct i mean a datastruct that is never changed, but all modifications return a new modified datastruct
#naturalog>	(that might internally be implemented by efficient diff)
#gpeti_>	copy on write...
#naturalog>	yes many synonyms
#naturalog>	but that's the terminology at this latter pds
#naturalog>	pdf
#naturalog>	the algo there is highly nontrivial and surprising, at least to my taste
#naturalog>	recently i implemented it in c (given their ocaml code)
#naturalog>	its there on our github under the dir "vm"
#gpeti_>	note I would call the copies as phases
#gpeti_>	are there an upper limit on these phases
#naturalog>	well
#naturalog>	if you do totality check, then yes
#gpeti_>	I mean are there only the original and the processed or many
#naturalog>	roughly speaking, every frame is a rule
#naturalog>	and it generates descendent frames (as a tree) which are rules that match this given rule
#naturalog>	i.e. their head match one of this rule's body
#naturalog>	the set of rules is fully given at the beginning
#naturalog>	so one can look at the mutations at the rule level rather substs
#naturalog>	i.e. rule mutate with actually doing the substition
#gpeti_>	can these algo reuse a previous conclusion without  calculating it again inside the super question
#naturalog>	it can
#naturalog>	but that'll be a separate optimization
#naturalog>	there are several interesting optiimzations in guido's thesis
#naturalog>	.g guido thesis rdf
#tau-bot>	naturalog: http://www.agfa.com/w3c/2002/02/thesis/thesis.pdf
#naturalog>	euler is implementation of ^
#gpeti_>	why can it not mark it calculated
#naturalog>	because same rule can be used many times
#gpeti_>	OK but the rules calculating could be a searchable object itself
#gpeti_>	and marked upon evaluating it
#naturalog>	not sure i understand
#gpeti_>	when the algo calculates the implication of some predicate
#naturalog>	^ that'll be forward tracking
#gpeti_>	it could semi persistently store it as an object searchable for later use within the same backtracking run in another sub context
#naturalog>	apparently
#naturalog>	it can be a good idea, but we have to see how it looks when we combine other optimizations, and in general, how the non-optimized compiler will look like
#naturalog>	i.e. optimized inference, but no higher level shortcuts yet
#gpeti_>	how I see how you are doing it now is logic centric as opposed to data centric
#gpeti_>	that is why you refer to compile vs interpret
#naturalog>	ah well the compile vs interpret is HMC_a's terminology but indeed we want to emit machine code
#naturalog>	a real jit compiler
#naturalog>	the algo doesnt come with a prescribed compilation algo, we have to come up with one
#naturalog>	and ofc im open for new ideas
#naturalog>	in a second thought, you might want to first get familiar with wam
#naturalog>	.g warner abstract machine
#tau-bot>	naturalog: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_machine
#gpeti_>	ofc I would also talk about machine code, but your machine code needs to interpret the data
#naturalog>	.g warren abstract machine
#tau-bot>	naturalog: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Abstract_Machine
#naturalog>	ah no! the machine code contains the data itself
#naturalog>	i.e., instead of "if (this->x == y)"
#naturalog>	the code will be "if (3 == y)"
#naturalog>	so that's a "real compilation" vs "just interpretation" id say
#gpeti_>	you have barcoded universal logic working on built-in and input predicates right
#naturalog>	טקד
#naturalog>	yes
#gpeti_>	are you saying that even in the case of input predicates first you compile, then evaluate?
#naturalog>	im not sure i understand
#naturalog>	i think you'll have to explain to me in more detail, the picture you have in mind
#gpeti_>	my last question was whether compilation takes place between the input of some user data (predicate) and running the the reasoning engine
#naturalog>	some is compiled aot and some is compiled jit
#naturalog>	most of the work is jit
#naturalog>	so the backtracking processes, instead of simply take place, has to emit code that performs it
#naturalog>	and since we cant predict the proof tree aot, we must compile it jit
#naturalog>	however we do know a lot of stuff aot and we better use it ofc
#naturalog>	there's so much to emphasize, this time im trying to keep it at the global view
#gpeti_>	I still need to check it out what are aot and jit
#naturalog>	depends on the design
#naturalog>	in my design, jit is merging to union-find datastructs
#naturalog>	and aot is building union-find datastructs per body per head
#naturalog>	i said it extremely shortly
#naturalog>	*merging two
#naturalog>	to go further i feel that i have to know we speak of the same inference picture
#naturalog>	specific inference implementation
#naturalog>	more specifically, euler
#naturalog>	the order of the proof tree generation and nodes should be as in current tau's interpreter (which is euler's order)
#naturalog>	we want to maintain the same order in compilation
#naturalog>	but there's a chance that we already see the same pic
#naturalog>	so please describe me yours, i'll learn anyway
#gpeti_>	I would first read Euler, since chances are that my limited self made approach is far inferior
#naturalog>	they're probably superior
#naturalog>	we use euler not because its faster
#naturalog>	in fact it's doing more work that could be done for "just proving"
#naturalog>	but for a more general point of view (of the whole tau chain), we'll rather have to keep this conservativeness
#naturalog>	since we have to keep it fully deterministic
#naturalog>	one node must be able to replay the very same execution path of another node given same input
#naturalog>	otherwise, the hash of the exeution tree wont be the same..
#naturalog>	and we wont have lambda-auth proofs..
#gpeti_>	a practical question: while tau compiled, p did not compile
#naturalog>	hmm try "make pcpp"
#gpeti_>	something about libs
#gpeti_>	yes pcpp it is
#naturalog>	cehcking
#gpeti_>	makefile has errors
#gpeti_>	refers to non existent header etc

#tau-git/#zennet-	tauchain/master 50a4188 troy: Makefile: fix pcpp target
	#tau-git (~tau-git@192.30.252.40) has left #zennet
#naturalog>	another reason we use euler's order and not a more efficient one,
#naturalog>	is that it is supposed to be a deterministic programming language
#naturalog>	i.e. the programmer has to be able to know the order of execution of their code
#naturalog>	i.e. thats another difference than "just proving"
#naturalog>	the builtins (that might have side effects, and are specialized predicates) must occur in order ofc
#gpeti_>	believe me I am sure that taking such an established theory from the shelf is a good choice
#naturalog>	sure and basically that's what we do
#naturalog>	the inference algo is guido's
#gpeti_>	I am not at all arguing with that
#naturalog>	and the compiler is LogicT or dragon/c&f/etc
	#Risky2 (~Risky2@unaffiliated/risky2) has joined #zennet
#gpeti_>	p.CPP:145:22: error: exception specification of overriding function is more lax than base version
#naturalog>	hmm
#naturalog>	on linux it builds
#naturalog>	oh you can just remove the GLIBC whatever on that line
#gpeti_>	clang++-3.4.1
#naturalog>	its only used to throw wchar_t* exceptions
#naturalog>	rather runtime_excetion that accepts char*
#naturalog>	so feel free to disable its base class etc
#gpeti_>	naturalog: compilation is targeted because of the polynomial running time gain compared to the interpreter?
#naturalog>	ah no the asymptotic complexity doesnt change by more than constants
#naturalog>	hmm even the non-asymptotoc complexity
#naturalog>	well
#naturalog>	maybe
#naturalog>	idk
#naturalog>	its a difficult question, to what extent unification can be optimized, but that's at the low scale
#gpeti_>	than what else motivates this change
#naturalog>	it has nothing to do with the shape of the proof tree, in which we have nothing to do till someone proves p=np
#naturalog>	so its about computing a single node in the proof tree
#naturalog>	the rest is pretty much hopeless wrt runtime complexity
#naturalog>	so that single node, is nothing but unification of two triples
#naturalog>	(that might be large since we allow nested lists)
#naturalog>	if they unify, then we have a connection between body and head
#naturalog>	that single node, is what euler is doing per queue pop
#naturalog>	the main loop
#naturalog>	or the loop in prove() in p.cpp
#naturalog>	though in p.cpp its a bit more complicated now as in prover.cpp
#naturalog>	there its at prover::step()

	#Quanttek (~quassel@ip1f11db5b.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) has joined #zennet
#stoopkid>	if you're french, isis is worse. if you're isis, the french are worse. if you're israeli, you're probably like "you both suck"
#naturalog>	heh israelis probably blame islam
#naturalog>	people will go to war instead of admitting their fault
#naturalog>	hollande will prefer a war rather admit he was wrong bombing (never mind if he was really wrong or not)
#stoopkid>	seeing as this is the case, isis just appears to be trying to stir up war
#naturalog>	depends against who
#naturalog>	they have enemies in iraq syria etc
#stoopkid>	against the middle east
#naturalog>	they didnt get france into biz
#naturalog>	or usa
#naturalog>	nato decided not only to intervene but to massively kill one side
#naturalog>	sometimes both sides
#naturalog>	this has consequences by the law of physics
#naturalog>	not only nato but russia etc etc
#naturalog>	so those good people came to bring peace
#naturalog>	by killing many many people
#naturalog>	and now theyre shocked how they dont recognize their peace freedom and democracy efforts
#stoopkid>	seems ww3 will be about middle eastern oil
#naturalog>	about the usd
#naturalog>	oil has such impact only because of the petrodollar
#naturalog>	so wars about oil are really wars about usd
#stoopkid>	that makes sense
#naturalog>	but its not only oil. recently i listened some to 'kay griggs' on youtube, recommended for hoobyist/professional history researcher
#naturalog>	she tells some about beyond that
#naturalog>	she also tells about "kabbalists that believe in killing good people"
#naturalog>	and about the navi doing murders just for fun and blame the arabs
#stoopkid>	navi?
#naturalog>	yes
#naturalog>	she was the wife of a navi colonel
#naturalog>	and became a whistleblower
#stoopkid>	navy?
#naturalog>	yes
#naturalog>	sea force
#stoopkid>	yea, i'd believe it
#stoopkid>	the amount of power some people have today is scary (even before we ask who those people are)
#stoopkid>	i feel like most people (at least americans) have no real concept of that
#stoopkid>	i'm sure people in other places do
#koo7>	hrrm
#naturalog>	see some of corey's great works and you'll think otherwise https://www.youtube.com/user/coreygilshuster
#stoopkid>	otherwise wrt?
#naturalog>	02:25 < stoopkid> i'm sure people in other places do
#naturalog>	they're all sunk in no less worse and false stories
#stoopkid>	mmm, i'm sure anybody living under a dictator or under the rule of cartels has an understanding of how scary the amount of power is
#naturalog>	well it turns out that game theory nobelists rather think that one should acquire much weapons etc in order to prevent war
#naturalog>	esp nuclear weapons
#naturalog>	they claim that the 'miracle' that the 20th century ended without nuclear war
#naturalog>	is because there are many players with bombs
#naturalog>	the cold war is a very popular research subject in game theory
#stoopkid>	well, it's not how much absolute power we have, it's how much power some people have relative to everybody else
#stoopkid>	and, we'll only take absolute power so far (at least as far as we're concerned)
#stoopkid>	once somebody has one bomb that can destroy the whole world it doesn't matter if you make a bigger bomb
#naturalog>	some prefer killing us softly
#naturalog>	i really really want to see some summary about the opinions in france now
#naturalog>	when hollande say "france is strong and we'll not break" he means "everyone including me thinks france is weak and will break"
#naturalog>	im not saying its true but that how they probably feel now
#stoopkid>	what do you mean "will break"?
#naturalog>	idk i just quote hollande and invert his statement
#naturalog>	he doesnt say every day to his people "france is strong and we'll not break"
#stoopkid>	hm, idk what he means
#naturalog>	this sentence has a meaning
#naturalog>	he said that in contrast to something
#naturalog>	in contrast to what?
#naturalog>	to the common feeling in france.
#naturalog>	he chose to say certain sentences. why did he chose those ones?
#naturalog>	including "we'll protect, we'll defend"
#naturalog>	while its well known there's pretty much nothing they can really do
#naturalog>	to defend
#naturalog>	only to offend
#naturalog>	thats all besides the tremendous ecomonical meaning of what happened, even without any escalation
#naturalog>	just the "protect" part, that won't work anyway, going to cost amounts that i doubt if hollande realize
#naturalog>	just the slightest fear in walking on the streets has such a huge economical impact
#stoopkid>	why did they bomb france in the first place, that seems like.. "out of their scope"
#naturalog>	because month ago france began to bomb them
#naturalog>	just google "syria france"
#naturalog>	thats what i spoke about above
#naturalog>	the airplanes
#naturalog>	france attacked isis first
#koo7>	here radio keeps going on about "refugee crysis" and about building fences
#naturalog>	in cz?
#koo7>	yeah
#naturalog>	refugees in cz?
#koo7>	no
#koo7>	well, little
#naturalog>	in eu
#koo7>	but the news are still full of them
#koo7>	yeah
#stoopkid>	isis units could easily slip in with all that commotion
#naturalog>	the gov always make more anti-immigration rules and anti-xenophobia rules
#koo7>	hehe
#stoopkid>	well, i figure this is going to escalate badly :)
#naturalog>	isnt it amazing how the media suppress the french attach on syria
#naturalog>	attack
#naturalog>	you get what's going here?
#stoopkid>	maybe?
#naturalog>	that attack was on the news 1.5 months ago
#naturalog>	where are the pictures? the opinions? the casualities?
#koo7>	its how long it takes for a piece of driftwood to float from syria to france?
#naturalog>	its like nothing of that happened and suddenly they bombed paris
#koo7>	well not long ago there was a similar incident in canada
#naturalog>	the media is obviously manipulative here
#stoopkid>	well, ofc, why would they admit wrong-doing
#stoopkid>	koo7: hadn't even heard of that
#naturalog>	the story on the news should begin "after france bombed isis, now they bombed them back."
#naturalog>	also they news here didnt begin this way at all, they didnt even mention that
#naturalog>	maybe hollande has some responsibility to what happened?
#naturalog>	why did he assume he'll bomb those crazy people from air and nothing would happen?
#naturalog>	and maybe they were rather innocent people? who knows?
#naturalog>	anyway, maybe the blood is rather much on hollande hands? i dont know, but thats something that should be discussed in the media
#naturalog>	you all know im not islamist by any means
#stoopkid>	well, yea, media manipulates, but that's not news
#koo7>	punny
#naturalog>	but we can see in live how the media is manipulating wars
#stoopkid>	sounds like we need an alternative media
#naturalog>	im sure that in a few days what i say here youll find all over youtube
#stoopkid>	if i happen to go looking for it
	#naturalog tries to listen some to al jazeera
#stoopkid>	or something similar
#naturalog>	i will
#naturalog>	"elections in syria in 18 months from now" is an opinion that all us/eu parties agree on (as i hear in al jazeera)
#naturalog>	we know the story dont we
#stoopkid>	not in nearly as much detail as i'd want to
#naturalog>	its very simple
#naturalog>	the very reason isis exists
#naturalog>	the very reason this all happened
#naturalog>	is because they wanted elections in iraq
#naturalog>	so they're going to fix it with elections in syria
#naturalog>	sounds very nonviolent, how can one object that
#naturalog>	ah but they cant have elections because there are yet many terrorists
#naturalog>	so they have to kill the terrorists first
#naturalog>	but they dont know who's terrorist
#naturalog>	so they kill anyway and terror resumes etc etc
#naturalog>	all for the great sake of forced elections
#naturalog>	john kerry speaks now (in french)
#koo7>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kr3a_JJ0RA
#naturalog>	mentions: 1. attack against humanity rather only france
#naturalog>	2. isis
#naturalog>	3. two world wars us+france together
#naturalog>	4. 'give france all support to track down the monsters'
#koo7>	british dude was even more elloquent
#naturalog>	ofc
#naturalog>	well idk who's worse
#naturalog>	but
#naturalog>	how many people killed in the 'arab spring' so far?
#naturalog>	idk, but way way far from 50 million
#naturalog>	like last time eu&us gone crazy
#koo7>	hm?
#naturalog>	?
#koo7>	shrug
#stoopkid>	yea europe & us really went at it
#naturalog>	he summarizes his goals in 3 steps (kerry)
#naturalog>	i forgot the other two
#naturalog>	number one was "eliminate isis"
#koo7>	trains and hot air baloons are cool
#koo7>	especially when they crash into stuff
#naturalog>	so yes it goes well with my prediction from yesterday so far
#naturalog>	very militant dialectics
#koo7>	yeah they are
#naturalog>	but yesterday it was too far for me to speak about ww3, but now after i hear kerry, i dont consider it scifi anymore
#naturalog>	"it is time that we come together and help to the syrian people"
#naturalog>	how? by killing the bad guys?
#naturalog>	by 'consulting' them?
#naturalog>	by 'arbitrating'?
#naturalog>	btw there's a fact they all either forgot or never heard of
#naturalog>	geographists warned almost 10 years ago about what happens there
#naturalog>	syria is simply out of water
#naturalog>	its becoming more and more desert there
#naturalog>	geographists knew and warned that something horrible is going to happen there
#naturalog>	but ofc the army prefer stories that come with funds
#stoopkid>	well, desertification is a more solvable issue, but can't be managed while everybody's fighting each other
#naturalog>	so if mr kerry really wanted to help the syrian people
#naturalog>	he'd dedesert syria
#naturalog>	same for mr hollande
#naturalog>	arent they green anymore?
#stoopkid>	were they ever?
#stoopkid>	yea, if they really wanted to help they would go in and de-desert and build infrastructure, but then they'd have to provide military support to guard this infrastructure to make sure they're not just giving free stuff to terrorists, so then the question becomes who are they guarding it 'for'? and then they're picking and choosing between different parts of the population and setting up their own structures of 'representation', and then it's just 
#stoopkid>	i don't think they really care much about helping in the first place though, so..
#stoopkid>	it's interesting we basically use war as a justification to side-step due process of law
#stoopkid>	no judge, no jury, just a bomb
#naturalog>	so they should judge the middle east? and who will judge them?
#naturalog>	btw its the reason they didnt want to judge the nazi criminals if the crimes was not considered international
#naturalog>	like the holocaust for example
#naturalog>	they dont want real international law cause they'll lose
#naturalog>	not that i support international law, i just state historical facts
#stoopkid>	what's the alternative to international law if we're to have mutual aid between states
#naturalog>	moreover thats the very reasons the arabs hate the west
#naturalog>	because they see themselves as leaders of the world even in the east's internal matters
#naturalog>	now usa,russia,france, they all decide syria's future
#stoopkid>	of course, we parade ourselves as world's first sole world super-power
#naturalog>	yeah and thats exactly the reason why they hate us so much
#stoopkid>	well, i would too
#naturalog>	ofc
#naturalog>	now if instead of france,
#stoopkid>	but, everybody else can't seem to unite enough with each other & with us to make enough of a force to change that asymmetry in power/representation, and the violence just shakes it more into place
#naturalog>	israel would bomb in syria 1m ago
#naturalog>	and then 150 were killed in a bombing in israel
#naturalog>	who would france blame?
#stoopkid>	depends which media outlet
#stoopkid>	mostly isis
#naturalog>	france is very pro muslim comparing to usa
#naturalog>	and israel
#naturalog>	well
#naturalog>	at least in how they present israel in the media
#naturalog>	but they all live in a fallacy like there's "freedom of speech"
#naturalog>	freedom to speak and license to brainwash
#stoopkid>	:)
#stoopkid>	so, how would the world go about fixing this
#naturalog>	the reason that war unites the people so much nowadays is the lack of family values as before
#naturalog>	people want to belong to something
#stoopkid>	i agree, but more generally community values
#naturalog>	so amazing how those ~150 french are "more important" than 300K syrians
#naturalog>	the latter are considered disposable
#naturalog>	"they're all terrorists"
#stoopkid>	yep
#naturalog>	the former are "innocent"
#naturalog>	haha kerry said that "isis is now under that category [terrorists] *now* "
#stoopkid>	they weren't already?
#naturalog>	he ephasized the "now"
#stoopkid>	lol
#stoopkid>	does he read the news?
#naturalog>	he reads very well
#naturalog>	you have to understand what beneath his words
#naturalog>	he's laying ground for legitimacy of war
#stoopkid>	of course
#naturalog>	usa attacked in libya a few mins ago
#stoopkid>	can we make an rdf format to describe military attacks?
#naturalog>	2 hours ago: a train got off rail in france
#naturalog>	5 killed
#naturalog>	society begins to tear down
#naturalog>	ofc ofc, no one speaks about the obv:
#naturalog>	it was a direct trial to assasin hollande.

#koo7>	(b)?
#koo7>	if you do like ?L rdf:first x, you match that with all bnodes of all lists, or something
#koo7>	our builtin should simulate that
#koo7>	we dont have these first/rest triples in the kb
#koo7>	so what we must do is iterate all heads of all facts..
#koo7>	and look for lists in both s and o positions, and for lists in those lists
#koo7>	can we cache that?
#koo7>	even if we do, does that sound like an optimization?
#koo7>	here i am wrestling multiple levels of optimization of something i have never even really used in my life

#HMC_a>	that has 0 results in any case?
#koo7>	you wish:p...
#HMC_a>	no srsly, that one has no result...
#koo7>	afaik qdb keeps the quads that the internalized lists are then constructed from, but the two arent linked in any way
#koo7>	i think what we need in univar terms is to, upon entry to rdf:first/rest, allocate a "locals" array that will contain a live version of all the lists
#HMC_a>	sure, just maintaining filtered versions of this map to limit the search in scope?
#HMC_a>	that works :-)
#koo7>	?
#koo7>	no im trying to see how to make this work at all
#HMC_a>	hrmm, then i'm not sure which aspect you struggle with...
#HMC_a>	you understand how it would work as triples (w/out internal lists) yah?

	#Quanttek (~quassel@ip1f11db5b.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) has joined #zennet
#HMC_a>	yes.  Remember the ?a is existential, not universal
#HMC_a>	and you have no existing list there ;-)
#HMC_a>	let alone any lists of length 3...
#koo7>	dunno what any of that means
#HMC_a>	well to make this match you would need some actual list(s) in the kb...
#koo7>	so (?a ?a ?a) foo (?a ?a ?a) . fin. ?l first a. fin. 0?
#HMC_a>	nothing ever actually matches the a, though?
#koo7>	though?
#koo7>	0 results?
#HMC_a>	"a" is not "?a"?
#HMC_a>	sec
#koo7>	right
#HMC_a>	let me try to put together a better example to explain
#HMC_a>	ah, you kinda tricked me without meaning to, i think... XD
#HMC_a>	your banana flavored pie should actually match, i think
#HMC_a>	let me check
#HMC_a>	i wasn't thinking about that tricky "all lists exist" rule there, heh
#HMC_a>	bah, i gtr for a bit
#HMC_a>	but yes, these do match, not exactly 0 result, heh...
#koo7>	(?a ?a ?a) foo (?a ?a ?a) . fin. ?l first a. fin. too?
#HMC_a>	yes, it just matches with ?l remaining a bnode... you don't get any actual list bound to ?l...
#HMC_a>	but see it is a special case, somewhat...
#HMC_a>	even with empty kb "?l rdf:first :whatever" will match...
#HMC_a>	so the :foo fact here is a red herring, not even related
#koo7>	well, im beyond confused
#HMC_a>	let me double check this point later and try to come up with a better example to illustrate how these cases work together
#koo7>	also what you mean with ?l remaining a bnode
#HMC_a>	but i gtg for the moment. :/
#koo7>	alrhgt
#gpeti>	there are a couple of terms in the talks: facts, internalization of facts, filtering, AOT vs JIT. If I understand right, facts are input that might become significant enough to be accepted as part of the core kb, and then they are internalized. Filtering is a preprocessing step when parsing of the relevant facts happen preparing for the solving step. This parsing is jit currently but ultimately it would be aot.
#gpeti>	if I got that right, then I do not get how filtering is done without actually running the solver
#koo7>	talks?
#gpeti>	i mena here on thee channel
#koo7>	ok i could try setting some of that straight but 
#koo7>	maybe some of that is specific to naturalog's branch
#koo7>	i never noticed the word "filtering" used here
#koo7>	in my vocabulary: facts are rules without bodies/conditions
#koo7>	internalization - like i wrote earlier, in rdf lists are a chain of bnodes, we kinda throw those away and construct a different representation
#koo7>	while loading the kb
#koo7>	maybe this is what you mean by filtering
#koo7>	jit and aot, whatever they are supposed to mean, refer to compilation of the kb into machine code, it has nothing to do with parsing
#koo7>	parsing the input files, at least
#gpeti>	before compilation what is the format of the already parsed input? Is it tokenized or stored as the input text?
	#sifar has quit (Quit: Bye)
#koo7>	qdb
#koo7>	the q is for quads
#koo7>	the input usually contains multiple graphs, so its a map from graph name to a list of triples in that graph
#koo7>	a rule has a graph for head and a graph for body
#koo7>	and in the @default, top level graph, you have a triple graph1 implies graph2
#koo7>	facts just sit in the @default graph directly
#koo7>	well there is another stage...
#koo7>	where things are turned into two parallell lists, one contains the heads, and one (possibly empty) bodies
#koo7>	at this point its "terms", which is a term taken from euler, its like a triple but can also contain those internalized lists
#koo7>	on univar i just took all this, shoved it into namespace old, and builded upon it, since we were already kinda familiar with it, i dont claim that the architecture still makes sense:)
#koo7>	but tldr:triples
#gpeti>	quad is triple+context?
#koo7>	yeah
#koo7>	context aka graph
#gpeti>	thanks koo7! I'll keep these in mind while reading the code.
#gpeti>	the other day you said something about branches
#gpeti>	did you mean in the version control, or something else?
#koo7>	version control
#gpeti>	so what branch should I focus on?
#gpeti>	what kind of process does this project follow?
#koo7>	anarchy
#gpeti>	that is my favorite!
#koo7>	hmc says naturalog is on a tangent, with the stuff he works on on master
#gpeti>	I don't know what is a tangent
#gpeti>	tangent in this context
#koo7>	that the thing he is building just wont have the right properties
#gpeti>	meaning not right for anarchy?
#koo7>	not right for tauchain
#koo7>	so at some point stoopkid got frustrated with that and sucked me into working on this yp-like thing that hmc has in mind, and thats branch univar2 now
#koo7>	each is a different algo
#gpeti>	which part needs more hands?
#koo7>	well, need may be a wrong word here
#koo7>	im tempted to say that naturalog tends to chop off any hands that touch his code, tho
#koo7>	seriously tho, the only thing i can say objectively, i guess, is that more people believe in univar 
#koo7>	possibly some extraterrestrials, too
#gpeti>	rather than univar2?
#koo7>	err i mean univar2
#gpeti>	what is the difference in one word?
#koo7>	"univar" has one dead commit that univar2 steered around
#koo7>	and continued on
#koo7>	when stoopkid decided he had enough of everything
#koo7>	err no i made univar2 when stoopkid started on some refactoring and i wanted to continue with what we had
#koo7>	univar works like http://yieldprolog.sourceforge.net/tutorial_toc.html
#koo7>	without cutting, negation, lists are currently represented as pascal strings, and part 4. Compiler is irrelevant
#koo7>	so, you only need to read one and a half part

#naturalog>	ill stop referring devs here for the meanwhile
#gpeti>	I am still digesting these statements about anarchy

#naturalog>	about my design HMC_a claims it wont beat O(n^2) (and he also admits he didnt understand my design), so he didnt say its not right for tau.....
#naturalog>	about chopping hands, its known that koo7 developed unrealistic paranoia like im deleting his code... every time he checked he found he deleted himself without noticing.....
#gpeti>	hehe
#naturalog>	about concensus, yes, among people who admit they dont understand my design :)
#naturalog>	there's much more to say but nm for now
#naturalog>	anyway its anarchy not because i want to, but because so far people didnt want to do what i think is needed (mainly because other interests) which is completely ok ofc, nevertheless i do seek for people to join my effort
#naturalog>	10:50 < koo7> gpeti, so, forget everything except univar.cpp
#naturalog>	"forget everything except the file i wrote and working at now"
#naturalog>	see the damage..
#naturalog>	while koo7 admits he has no interest in blockchain or everything in tau beyond the reasoner
#naturalog>	so thats anarchy per se, hence thats what i meant, that this is how those things should be accepted. it's not anarchy per tau
#gpeti>	you mean anarchy in the sense that people do not coordinate when picking an area for developing it further
#naturalog>	not coordinating is anarchy i can live with
#naturalog>	it wont contribute to the development at the sense of getting to genesis fast, but it doesnt disturb

#rszeno>	hi, :)
#koo7>	:)
#rszeno>	rdf lists are linked lists
#rszeno>	so once you have implemented unification and walk on list you almost have what you need
#koo7>	yes but hmc wants the internalization optimization
#koo7>	while ofc i dont have any idea how it would work even without:)
#koo7>	maybe it goes back to us not quite supporting bnodes yet
#rszeno>	maybe knuth was right about premature optimisation that is the root of all evils. :)
#koo7>	maybe!
#rszeno>	you can't get rid of bnodes, are existential quantified variables
#gpeti>	koo7: as per your suggestion I obtained branch unvar2
#gpeti>	tried to build it, but:
#gpeti>	clang++: error: invalid argument '-fsanitize=undefined' not allowed with '-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error'
#koo7>	gpeti, sounds like old clang
#rszeno>	clang version problems?
#gpeti>	3.4.1
#koo7>	just tweak the ASAN line in Makefile
#koo7>	or do like env ASAN="" make -e
#koo7>	rszeno, existential vs ...?
#rszeno>	universal
#rszeno>	like in exists x such that ...
#rszeno>	_:koo :name "koo7" .
#rszeno>	_:koo :name "koo5" .
#rszeno>	first _:koo and second are different variables but after unification once can subst another
#rszeno>	backward chaning work only with universal quantificated variables so there is a step, skolemisation, before feeding the reasoner

#koo7>	what we have in tau are just existential?
#stoopkid>	mm
#stoopkid>	idk the proper terminology for the quantification we do in tau
#stoopkid>	the semantics are like "for all existing"
#stoopkid>	i guess that's just a universal quantification but idk if there's a subtle distinction
#rszeno>	so in _:koo :name "koo7" . _:koo is universal quantified var?
#stoopkid>	_:koo is not a var
#rszeno>	is bnode, so is a variable
#hazirafel>	rszeno brodway 80
#rszeno>	hazirafel, thank you i will look for it, :)
#hazirafel>	:D never
#rszeno>	i need it at least to know what to avoid, :)
#stoopkid>	ah you're right: http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wg/wiki/bNode_Semantics.html
#stoopkid>	"n fact, it turns out that bNodes can be interpreted as existentially quantified variables in first-order logical languages."
#rszeno>	yes but you need to understand the meaning, and why is so
#rszeno>	doesn't matter the subject if your statement is a fact
#rszeno>	but when is not you introduce something you don't know, and probably doesn't matter and use name for it, so is a variable
#stoopkid>	yea its a bit subtle but it makes sense
#rszeno>	since is special for that relation can't be universal, are only "some"
#hazirafel>	tau-pot
#rszeno>	you could see a quantified var like a universal one with some constraints
#rszeno>	tau-tabbaco, :)
#stoopkid>	koo7: to skolemize you just replace each different blank node with a fresh unique IRI
#koo7>	isnt each blank node already an unique iri?
#stoopkid>	might be, idk how that's set up right now
#rszeno>	the replacement doesn't make skolemisation
#rszeno>	brb
#stoopkid>	http://answers.semanticweb.com/questions/8336/what-is-skolemization?page=1#8376
#stoopkid>	im not sure what else is necessary to make skolemization besides the replacement
#stoopkid>	i'm also not necessarily sure why we need skolemization, since i thought blank nodes & IRIs were already being mapped to separate unique identifiers in tau
#stoopkid>	http://answers.semanticweb.com/questions/8336/what-is-skolemization
#stoopkid>	its like "replace blank nodes with fresh IRIs but remember that these IRIs actually represent blank nodes"
#koo7>	<HMC_a> even with empty kb "?l rdf:first :whatever" will match...
#stoopkid>	why?
#rszeno>	stoopkid, "red apples are red because are red", :)
#koo7>	yea
#koo7>	<HMC_a> yes, it just matches with ?l remaining a bnode... you don't get any actual list bound to ?l...
#stoopkid>	so your query is not a query, its a statement
#rszeno>	once you replace bnode with new iris and *remeber" that are bnodes, you are only sure there are uniq
#koo7>	all i know is that thing2node will say "Wtf did you send me?"
#rszeno>	is called tautology
#rszeno>	back to existential vs. universal
#rszeno>	x * x = 25
#stoopkid>	what can "?l rdf:first :whatever" match with on an empty kb besides itself
#koo7>	what itself?
#rszeno>	x can't be universal, because not for all x the relation x * x = 25 is true
#koo7>	ok...
#stoopkid>	i mean, i interpreted "?l rdf:first :whatever" as being a question, "does there exist ?l such that ?l has rdf:first with value :whatever"
#stoopkid>	with an empty kb i'd expect this answer to be "no"
#koo7>	yeah
#stoopkid>	but HMC_a appears to be saying that it's not a question, it's a statement
#koo7>	hmm
#stoopkid>	"?l rdf:first :whatever" apparently is "there exists ?l such that ?l has rdf:first with value :whatever"
#stoopkid>	and apparently we just accept this as fact unless there's a contradiction in the kb
#rszeno>	is not a statement except if HMC_a want to extend the meaning of a statement
#rszeno>	actualy the unification fail, so is the *third* state
#stoopkid>	yea it seems unification must fail on that because there's nothing to unify with
#rszeno>	yes, right
#stoopkid>	so yea idk where the extra semantics come in that are supposed to make it a 'valid match'
#koo7>	so what does he mean by match?
#rszeno>	no match
#koo7>	he said something about "all lists exist"
#stoopkid>	like the list of all lists that don't contain themselves?
#stoopkid>	idk, it seems that if all lists exist then we don't need to have lists as a feature
#koo7>	:D
#rszeno>	thin like air, can be ignored? :)
#rszeno>	(?x ?x) math:product "25"^^xs:integer .
#rszeno>	so we have lists and exists here, :)
#rszeno>	or bnodes
#rszeno>	_:b0 math: product "25"^^xs;integer .
#rszeno>	_:b0 rdf:first ?x .
#rszeno>	_:b0 rdf:rest _:b1 .
#rszeno>	_b1 rdf:first ?x .
#rszeno>	_:b1 rdf:rest rdf:nil .
#rszeno>	5 quads instead
#koo7>	yeah......
#koo7>	now, how i have things implemented now, lists are internalized, and the two ?x's will simply be one memory address, in the product coro
#rszeno>	the _:b0 probably
#koo7>	no i mean the ?x
#rszeno>	and the result of the math: product?, the subject?
#koo7>	but what happens if math:product had to call rdf:first to find where to put the result?
#koo7>	hmm not sure what you mean
#rszeno>	math: product never reach rdf:first, will call _:b0
#koo7>	how does one call _:b0?
#stoopkid>	well, it'll only call rdf:first if there's a rule like {?a rdf:first ?b} => {?c math:product ?d}
#rszeno>	is a builtin with two arguments
#rszeno>	so you need to find arguments first
#koo7>	yeas
#rszeno>	this is why you need existential and not universal quantification
#rszeno>	because make it universal you need to match not(x * x = 25)
#rszeno>	so all integers x except 5
#rszeno>	this is what skolemisation do
#rszeno>	so you need to use backchaining to find x for not(x*x = 25)
#rszeno>	confusing?

#rszeno>	ok, this is for sure a "non-halting" thing, is not constructive so we better avoid to continue
#stoopkid>	it's not any more tricky than classical math, which can't be claimed to be easy since even the primitive operations of arithmetic need to be beaten into childrens' heads over the course of years
#stoopkid>	propositions is are types, proofs are programs, and the whole thing makes a lot more sense this way
#rszeno>	what do you think koo7? :)
#koo7>	HMC_a, continuing from rszeno's math:product above, i dont see how to implement a rdffirst/rest that will: 1) yield out a variable 2) a variable that knows its the same as a different variable 
#koo7>	rszeno, im not here to think;)
#rszeno>	ok, :)
#koo7>	but "non-halting" is a good term
#rszeno>	i used it because i guess stoopkid see everything as computation theory, :)
#koo7>	im not sure, hes just into math in general
#koo7>	id say he rather sees it as a language
#stoopkid>	thats a good way to put it
#koo7>	HMC_a, i mean, i can do it, we can have one global lists list with vars and stuff and rdffirst calls can yield the adressess of that stuff, but is that what you have in mind?
#koo7>	maybe it would have to be not global but local per a rule thats the caller of the rdffirst or something whacky like that
#koo7>	but then i kinda see how lists with variables dont exist
#koo7>	its like we have two different kinds of lists
#koo7>	dunno
#koo7>	long story short, rdffirst/rest just shouldnt yield any lists that contain variables?
#koo7>	what about a query like 5 in ?x. ?x product 25., if "in" is defined in terms of first/rest
#rszeno>	is a recursive definition
#koo7>	what is?
#rszeno>	rdf lists, rdf:first is the head of the list and rdf:rest is the tail
#koo7>	sure
#koo7>	they should both use some magical function that enumerates lists that exist in the kb 
#koo7>	shrug
#rszeno>	if a is a list (1, 2, 3, 4)
#rszeno>	then head is 1, tail is (2, 3, 4)
#koo7>	yeah
#rszeno>	so whatever you apply to a you must process the head, then the tail but since tail is a list, ....
#koo7>	whats your point?:p
#koo7>	trying to throw stoopkid into an endless loop
#rszeno>	about "rdffirst/rest just shouldnt yield any lists that contain variables?"
#rszeno>	at first step rest is exactly the list
#rszeno>	if you unifiy two lists they must have same length
	#koo7 shrugs
#stoopkid>	lists with variables don't exist?
#koo7>	is ?a b ?c true if nothing says it is?
#stoopkid>	apparently HMC_a thinks so
#rszeno>	passing args to multiargs function is done wit lists in n3
#rszeno>	so lists could contain vars
#stoopkid>	so "query: ?l rdf:first :whatever" should match, but "query: ?l rdf:first ?x" should not?
#stoopkid>	(assuming empty kb here)
#rszeno>	to match ?I you should have a list in kb and therefor will fail
#rszeno>	at first step
#stoopkid>	well, yea
#stoopkid>	both should fail
#rszeno>	second if you *have a list his head must be :whatever
#rszeno>	second will match for any head
#rszeno>	i mean second query
#stoopkid>	but the kb is empty, so there's no heads, both should fail
#rszeno>	actualy ?I in both queries ask for the head of a list not for the list
#stoopkid>	but then:
#stoopkid>	"<HMC_a> even with empty kb "?l rdf:first :whatever" will match..."
#stoopkid>	so if "?l rdf:first :whatever" matches, then that seems it would imply that "?l rdf:first ?x" must match on an empty kb as well
#stoopkid>	because, ?l rdf:first ?x should match if there exists a list with a head
#stoopkid>	and since ?l rdf:first :whatever matches, that implies there exists a list with the head ":whatever"
#rszeno>	sorry, i don't know the context when HMC_a said this so i don't know if is wrong, usualy is not, :)
#rszeno>	stoopkid, yes, you are right
#stoopkid>	so, "query: ?l rdf:first ?x" has infinite results: every possible list
#stoopkid>	(i'm just following the logical implications of HMC's statements here, which i also don't know the context of)
#rszeno>	yes, or more simple, ?x remain free, unbound and ?I = (?x)

	#tromp (~tromp@rtc35-246.rentec.com) has joined #zennet
#rszeno>	unification in this case give a subst { ?I <- ?x }
#rszeno>	sorry, is a mistake before, is not ?I = (?x) is ?l = ?x
#rszeno>	i just said before that ?I ask for the head, but ...
#rszeno>	lists are not the only case of containers in n3/rdf
#rszeno>	are also sets ($ 2, 3, 5 $)
#rszeno>	which use owl:one-of in cwm for example
#rszeno>	or {$ 2 3 5 $}, sets too
#rszeno>	syntax is different only
#rszeno>	@prefix p: <#> .

#rszeno>	i doubt are many n3 user which know what this mean, :)

#rszeno>	and is valid notation3
#rszeno>	yes, but in this case, p:o1 = p:o2 = p:o3
#koo7>	i did my homework, err, parser
#rszeno>	good, :)
#rszeno>	paths too?
#koo7>	no
#rszeno>	why? are critical
#koo7>	i never used any:)
#rszeno>	many time you have no choice
#koo7>	i thought its sugar
#rszeno>	plus is shorter and readable
#rszeno>	yes, it is but same are containers
#koo7>	i dont even have bnodes
#rszeno>	nobody stop you to use a flat form
#rszeno>	how you can't have  bnodes?
#koo7>	shrug
#koo7>	even if i parsed it, i wouldnt know what to do with it wrt tau
#stoopkid>	http://www.eonline.com/news/716061/john-oliver-airs-his-uncensored-feelings-on-the-paris-terrorist-attacks-f-k-these-a-holes  yay western hypocrisy
#rszeno>	about parsing and bnodes
#rszeno>	if you have two literals "now\nsome shit here" and """now
#rszeno>	some shit here"""
#rszeno>	you need to know if first is same as second
#rszeno>	pretty confusing because you need to have both in a normal form, bot having \n or 0x0a instead
#rszeno>	so you can solve the normalisation at parsing time or you can assign a bnode for each literal and delay the decision that represent same literal untill you need it
#koo7>	with rdf:value?
#rszeno>	later is the standard method
#stoopkid>	seems like a good approach
#rszeno>	yes, it is because even after normalisation, which is always done at parsing time, comparing strings is tricky
#rszeno>	so you can let user use a custom compare method
#koo7>	i think im gonna nap, thanks guys
#rszeno>	for example, week days in few languages

#HMC_a>	adam789654123: i've been thinking about your "mock tau" quit a bit the past few days, while i've been studying the new idris elaborator changes
#adam789654123>	awsome
#adam789654123>	i have *so* many ideas that my head is on fire

#adam789654123>	HMC_a: can i peruse what youve been studying?
#adam789654123>	concerning the new idris elaborator?
#stoopkid>	also
#adam789654123>	might help to serve as a launchpad to more deep discussion concerning "mock tau"
#stoopkid>	HMC_a: why would we want infinite solutions
#stoopkid>	if i queried "?l rdf:first ?x" against an empty kb and it came back with "no results found" i'd be like "yea that makes sense"
#HMC_a>	adam789654123: i've just been trying to get familiar with writing Elab scripts and the new metavar expander, in place of the old itp/atp interface
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: in rdf there is a tricky caveat, all possible lists are assumed to exist
#HMC_a>	so there are lists that begin with ?x regardless of the value of ?x or state pf the kb....
#adam789654123>	HMC_a: is it possible that we could work on trivial projects in Idris together?
#HMC_a>	this may seem strange, but it is indeed how cwm, euler, et al (racer, pwlim, jena, the lot) do work
#HMC_a>	try it at home!
#stoopkid>	i'm at a loss as to how this benefits us, or are we just trying to match RDF semantics because we're claiming that we're going to match RDF semantics?
#adam789654123>	HMC_a: my thinking is, you are the local idris "expert", and if i can learn it, i can teach it
#stoopkid>	adam789654123: have you been experimenting with idris yet?
#adam789654123>	not at all
#adam789654123>	but could this catapult me in the direction envisioned by HMC_a ?
#stoopkid>	get haskell-platform and then get idris and go through the tutorial, or we can play with it on azure if you want, it's already installed there
#adam789654123>	with regaurds to Tau and Idris?
#adam789654123>	ok
#adam789654123>	how about azure fist
#adam789654123>	then
#adam789654123>	do i need js though?
#stoopkid>	no
#stoopkid>	just ssh
#adam789654123>	ok
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: well technically it is to match McCarthy's theory of arrays, but that is just minutia really
#stoopkid>	mmm
#adam789654123>	stoopkid: can we make plans to do this tomorrow?
#adam789654123>	stoopkid: or some time this week maybe?
#adam789654123>	maybe this weekend?
#adam789654123>	its just that im under the gun today
#adam789654123>	there's a method to my madness
#stoopkid>	this week for sure, and possibly tomorrow, but i'm gonna be going to a lecture about US imperialism in the Philippines in the afternoon/evening
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: suffice to say that this is a very old soundness-of-closure detail that survived through and was inherited into rdf
#HMC_a>	it is a tricky caveat conceptually, but actually very easy to implement for us :-)
#stoopkid>	HMC_a: got a link to McCarthy's work?
#adam789654123>	well... if either of you want to do that, it would be cool
#HMC_a>	.g mccarthy theory of arrays
#tau-bot>	HMC_a: http://theory.stanford.edu/~arbrad/papers/arrays.ps
#HMC_a>	.g mccarthy array axiom
#tau-bot>	HMC_a: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leonardo/files/fmcad09.pdf
#adam789654123>	in lieu of that, im going to be starting with idris after i get the basic scaffolding up for my current project
#HMC_a>	hr,m
#stoopkid>	HMC_a: ill find it no worries
#adam789654123>	which i plan to be related to prototyping for something like a "tau accademy" or somesuch
#stoopkid>	well, if there's any software that ever needed its own academy, it's tau-chain
#koo7>	lol
#adam789654123>	it needs *very* knowegable first users
#adam789654123>	and methods of collaberation
#adam789654123>	and coordination
#adam789654123>	the trajectory is... one to two months for the basic scaffolding to get set
#HMC_a>	anyway, long story short: if rdf:first has an unbound subject then it is trivially true. :-)
#adam789654123>	then starting with idris and "mock tau" with "tau academy" as a background project
#HMC_a>	it is tautology
#HMC_a>	:-D
#stoopkid>	the time-frame we've been loosely operating under is having tau itself done by february-ish
#adam789654123>	well..... i know im lacking coordination with the real tau project
#adam789654123>	but it just seems neccesary at this point
#adam789654123>	im trying something out, and *perhaps* it will be worthwhile after the dust settles
#stoopkid>	i'm thinking it makes more sense to say that the 'mock tau' is the thing we're already working on, and your idris version could be the 'real deal'
#HMC_a>	i wonder if we can easily build our reasoner semantics on top of idris' preorder reasoning
#adam789654123>	stoopkid: because i dont want to step on naturalog's and koo7's toes
#koo7>	i dont have any toes
#adam789654123>	haha
#stoopkid>	then tell naturalog and koo7 to move their toes
#adam789654123>	haha.... i love the work naturalog is doing
#adam789654123>	that interview was awsome
#stoopkid>	yea im jk, but for real you aren't stepping on anybody's toes with this
#adam789654123>	but i still want to be very cautious, *because* i so much appreciate everyones work
#adam789654123>	we can iron out alot through "the collaberative process" in the future
#HMC_a>	i've said before that tau users should be naturally wary of any proposals with 0 "competing proposals" in any context....
#adam789654123>	haha
#HMC_a>	this applies here too...
#adam789654123>	if thats the way tau works, then so be it
#HMC_a>	and relates to what I said re "anarchy"
#adam789654123>	but i actually *did* have a different vision than it being main tau
#HMC_a>	so don't fear toe-stepping...
#adam789654123>	if parts are incorporated, then cool
#adam789654123>	but my idea was for a pedagogic and experimental tool
#stoopkid>	i think i said one time about something "if nobody has any opinions about this then i'll just assert my own, such is the way of the tau"
#HMC_a>	tau will thrive in such chaos, by design
#HMC_a>	"antifragile" and all.........
#adam789654123>	something simple, without perhaps necesary optimizations for a full tau system
#adam789654123>	ok
#adam789654123>	i still have to look into that
#adam789654123>	i wanted a gateway to bring people to the table
#HMC_a>	:-)
#stoopkid>	HMC_a: so, if i query "?l rdf:first ?x" and this has an infinite solution set, then what does this query return?
#adam789654123>	perhaps, turn people who are just ferociously interested and turn them into full flegde tau hacker types
#adam789654123>	myself included
#stoopkid>	adam789654123: have you installed tau and started playing with tau-code?
#adam789654123>	when you think about it, "mock tau" and "tau accademy" go together perfectly
#adam789654123>	stoopkid: no
#adam789654123>	which makes me seem....... fricken retarded
#stoopkid>	ok we can play on azure for that too
#adam789654123>	ok
#adam789654123>	im gonna get to programming, and after that, i have "chores", so im gonna sit here, but im out
#adam789654123>	i will *announce* my return
#adam789654123>	:P
#adam789654123>	cya
#stoopkid>	ok, next time you're around we'll get on azure and i can show you how it all works
#stoopkid>	cya later
#adam789654123>	see you my irc buddy
#adam789654123>	:)
#stoopkid>	:3
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: it returns with ?l and ?x left as unbound vars!  It returns "?l rdf:first ?x"... in the "result graph" this is a top level statement, so the vars are considered as existential!  So it returns exactly a statement interpreted as "there exists a list l and a node x such that x is the rdf:first of l" which is ofc tautologicaly true regardless of what the kb state is. ;-)
#HMC_a>	our universal vars like ?foo are also bnodes, remember
#HMC_a>	all vars are bnodes, all bnodes are vars! XD
#stoopkid>	ok so it just returns the existential vars, it doesn't return the infinite solution set, gotcha
#HMC_a>	the ones we write like ?foo are universals in subformulae and existential at top level (we use "quantifier alternation" instead of tricky @forall type crap and skolem rewrites and such... mostly just "because we can and it is easier"... ("we can" because we are ordinal and do not allow nesting of formulae at the term rewrite))
#HMC_a>	so nothing rszeno said was wrong wrt more general reasoner semantics, we are just playing on our constraints there wrt skolem et al
#HMC_a>	and "skipping around" some of the more complex semantic details that would occur if we cared for more general formula interpretation :-)
#HMC_a>	anyway
#stoopkid>	now, i'm still iffy on calling vars universals, it seems to me that they are always existential and that it's the {}=>{} that makes for universal quantification
#HMC_a>	the ones we write like _:foo are existentials, and similarly ones like ?foo at a top level in a syntactic unit are considered existential as a sort of special case, and there are some other "tricky" special cases that "sneak in" like variables that appear in a head but not a body end up as something like "doesn't matter which" quantifier in a sense, but again these are all details of our particular reasoner, not of more general rdf.... HEH
#HMC_a>	19:56 < stoopkid> now, i'm still iffy on calling vars universals, it seems to me that they are always existential and that it's the {}=>{} that makes for universal quantification
#HMC_a>	right, you're not exactly wrong at all...
#HMC_a>	how you are looking at it is sound for our reasoner
#HMC_a>	but is not sound for rdf reasoning in general! hehe
#HMC_a>	in more general rdf reasoning you might run into statements that are structured arbitrarily, where the corresponding predicate fol expression would have arbitrary implication and quantifier placement
#HMC_a>	we do *not* allow arbitrary implication structures *or* arbitrary quantifier placement!! hehe
#stoopkid>	i see
#HMC_a>	well, more accurately, we allow them syntactically but do not reason over them directly in our semantics! :-)
#HMC_a>	we only take "outer" implications (not nested) in our inference chaining, and we determine quantifiers (universal or existential) by placement relative to these 
#HMC_a>	someone could ofc write, in our logic, an interpretation that *does* consider things like nested implications, arbitrary quantifications, and a math:sum that will do factoring of objects to bind subject lists...
#HMC_a>	but we do none of these things in our "core" rewrite semantics. :-)
#HMC_a>	does this help to clear up some confusions, or only create more? XD
#koo7>	bla bla bla bla bla
#stoopkid>	i think it clears things up; so when we impose these constraints, it limits the semantics of universal/existential quantification in a way that makes my interpretation make sense?
	#HMC_a nods
#stoopkid>	ok, so note to self: memorize the discrepancy between my interpretation and the actual RDF interpretation
#HMC_a>	koo7: again, long story short, it comes down to this: when rdf:first builtin gets hit with an unbound subject, it is considered trivially true, and just yields a match without creating any new bindings. :-)
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: start with the history/debate around @forAll and graph merging, and focus on the interactions with nesting of implications and how it impacts the reasoner complexity. :-D
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: these details are also kind of good lead-in to a discussion of why the semantic web "failed" (luls) in its current form
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: and also good lead-in to a really deep understanding of why tau injects the "new type theory" (mltt) into the semweb stack specifically where/how it does (above rdfs, below owl)
#stoopkid>	mmm, i've recently been thinking that the reason it "failed" is less to do with anything 'lacking' in the semantics and more to do with lacking a spirit of collaboration in building up large sem-web graphs
#HMC_a>	hehe
#HMC_a>	well you're not wrong
#HMC_a>	but in the context of tau it is probably good to understand some of the interplay between the social and technical aspects of the history of how this collaborative spirit "died young"
#HMC_a>	the problem, in a nutshell, was that OWL was not pragmatically useful, because suddenly parts of the web could spit arbitrarily complex knowledge at eachother to be processed... (think like "implicit DDoS" heh)
#HMC_a>	this was both great and horrible, it turns out. ;-)
#HMC_a>	basically we agreed too quickly, with too loose of a consensus, on too powerful of a system!
#HMC_a>	and then people tried to actually live with it, and... well.. it quickly degraded into something *heavily* reminiscent of that Tower of Babel story... ;-)
#HMC_a>	ofc nobody was going to go all the way to owl-full on any system that communicated knowledge with other domains, because those external entities could just ask you something undecideable pretty trivially... 
	#adam789654123 peruses HMC_a and sees HMC is on a roll
#HMC_a>	so ofc various owl-dl interpretation subsets were tried, with people putting their "acceptable complexities" at various points, but generally still "too high"... 
	#adam789654123 saves file and will carefully read later
#HMC_a>	and then suddenly noone could communicate in consistent semantics anyway, because everyone was one a different owl subset, anyway...
#HMC_a>	and, well, knowledge exchange at a level of anything above rdfs broke down
#HMC_a>	and even rdfs eroded in the same way (you'd be hard pressed to find someone actualy running full rdfs semantics, hehe)
#stoopkid>	'we'... interesting :) now, one might say that this still is less to do with the semantics itself and more a problem of lacking the tools/concepts/communities necessary to reach useful consensus quickly & effectively enough
#HMC_a>	and now what survived of the semweb's *semantics* got stuck in this safe and comfortable "partial rdfs" land (just look at most any json-ld in the wild!) and the real capabilities of anything higher level were never meaningfully realized :-)
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: the problem is that noone could agree on how to build the tooling...
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: there was never "one semantic to rule them all"... mostly just a lot of different oppinions of what sort of *turing machines* to support (HEH wink wink nudge nudge)
#HMC_a>	so tool interoperability (the whole point of the semweb in the first place, no?) never hapened... barely even happened at the most base layers (rdf/rdfs)
#HMC_a>	*happened
#HMC_a>	NOW... today is a slightly different story (and tomorrow moreso)
#HMC_a>	now we have had a *lot* of academic study of where things did fall over, and a good understanding of where we went wrong
#HMC_a>	and it turns out to align almost exactly to this *other* ongoing parallel study of why software systems written in "certain" languages tend to explode...
#HMC_a>	that second line of work being what lead us to berendregt and twelf/agda/idris/et-al as the basis for new software languages, hehe
#HMC_a>	both problems being studied turn out to really be the same problem in the end, something deep about the meaning of a "universe of discourse"... something godel saw buried deeply but only communicated a loose vision of to us, hehe ;-)
#HMC_a>	so, in short, today we "more or less" know a solution now... that we actually "knew" at the time (mltt is oooold stuff, really) but didn't quite understand as fitting the problem in the first place :-)
#HMC_a>	anyway, that is a lot of tangent
#HMC_a>	what i really meant to say was
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: yes, study this distinction well. :-D
#HMC_a>	back to more practical matters
#stoopkid>	hmm, i guess its hard for me to put myself in the shoes of everyone who worked on this before this 'realization', because i've come into sem-web and mltt after the fact, and in my mind sem-web, decentralization & mltt make one trifecta
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: hehe, very few have actually had that "realization" yet.  don't worry, you're stil coming in on the bleeding edge! ;-)
#HMC_a>	sound ontology alignment is stil consdered generally an intractible problem.  This realization that it is actually just the same universe polymorphism inconsistency problem faced by Russel/Burali-Forti/Girard is not something that comes lightly, and is not something that was even brought to light until very recently
#HMC_a>	but yes, now that it has, "owl over mltt" seems like an "obvious" solution to the "safe" transaction of this higher level (potentially high complexiy) knowledge in a distributed setting, eh?
#HMC_a>	certainly a "trifecta" as you put it ;-)
#stoopkid>	'universe polymorphism inconsistency' as in, they didn't enforce a heirarchy of universes and allowed objects and universes that contain them to intermingle as if they were all in the same universe?
#HMC_a>	koo7: so it seems to me that the rdf:first builtin should actually be easy... if the subject is bound, and bound to a list just take it's first item.  If it is bound to something that is not a list, fail.  If it is unbound, do a trivial yield (no new binding first).
#HMC_a>	by "take its first item" i mean ofc unify it's first item against the object
#HMC_a>	stoopkid: basically.  In the end it turns out to be a problem of no way to meaningfully define relations of "context" of triples. ;-)
#stoopkid>	hmmm, how to ask what you mean by that when the assumption is that it's not meaningfully defined..
#HMC_a>	well
#HMC_a>	imagine the problem of grabbing two arbitrary rdf/rdfs/owl knowledgebases from the web
#HMC_a>	and doing ontology alignment (by hand or by automation, either) to merge them into one (still consistent) kb.
#HMC_a>	in general this problem is undecideable
#HMC_a>	there are graphs which will have no consistent merging
#HMC_a>	their universes of discourse might be directly contradictory, leaving no sound combination.  Woops, ontology alignment fail, and there's no "logical recourse"
#HMC_a>	so that is the ultimate problem in a nutshell, two arbitrary knowledgebases might never be *able* to be made to align.
#HMC_a>	and, in a nutshell, exactly how we resolve this problem is by providing the missing "logical recourse"... a facility to position a third universe of discourse around/"above" both contexts
#stoopkid>	and using rdf/rdfs/owl kbs, the problem of deciding whether or not two arbitrary knowledgebases will be able to align is undecidable
#HMC_a>	well, the decision problem for two specific instances *is* decideable, but it is NPC! hehe
#HMC_a>	so that is "little comfort" pragmatically
#HMC_a>	any sufficiently large KBs and even a brute force alignment might never happen before the sun burns out, yknow?
#HMC_a>	20:50 < HMC_a> well, the decision problem for two specific instances *is* decideable, but it is NPC! hehe
#HMC_a>	n.b.: here I'm assuming OWL-DL
#HMC_a>	decision problem over instances for owl-full is undecideable implicitly, but that is because consistency of even one kb may be undecideable in owl-full, heh... ;-)
#stoopkid>	right, no owl-full :) but, how exactly does positioning a third universe of discourse above both contexts resolve the problem?
#HMC_a>	because in one universe it remains true that X, and in the other universe it remains false that X, while in the third parent universe it is constructively only the case that "it is true that it is true that in the first universe X" and "it is true that it is not true that in the second universe X"
#stoopkid>	i see
#stoopkid>	that would actually have been my solution and per usual i wouldn't have realized that i was actually doing math XD
#HMC_a>	hehe, well this notion is quite "natural" once you "get" mltt at all, huh?
#HMC_a>	but coming from the background of rdf, with its particular logical roots, this might seem quite alien. ;-)
#stoopkid>	well, i still need to get mltt a lot better than i do, but yea it makes a lot of sense
#HMC_a>	anyway, now we've gotten on *quite* the tangent from the matter at hand... rdf:first... :-D
#stoopkid>	:)
#stoopkid>	ok enough tangential questions from me for now
#HMC_a>	i find it helpful with stuff like the list semantics to just continually double check myself against cwm and euler.yap, heh
#stoopkid>	adam789654123: yea definitely read through this discussion later, some very important points. might need some more background context for it to really mean anything to you though
#stoopkid>	gotta run, catch y'all later
	#stoopkid has quit (Quit: leaving)
#koo7>	{ ?x rdf:first ?y. (?x ?x) math:product 25 } => {1 outputString ?x}
#koo7>	err
#koo7>	{ ?x rdf:first ?y. ?x math:product 25 } => {1 outputString ?y}
#koo7>	or rather
#koo7>	{ ?x rdf:first ?y. ?x math:product 25 . 1 outputString ?y} => { does this match }
#koo7>	i find cwm unhelpful because i can never get past the @forall and all that variables stuff
#HMC_a>	you can just use cwm as if it employed our semantic rules and it will "just work"... mostly this just means converting any "?foo" in a top level fact to be "_:foo" instead
#HMC_a>	then the rest "just works" omitting all the @forAll and junk
#HMC_a>	cwm (with this one top level syntax exception) follows our same rules about implied quantifications
#HMC_a>	anyway wrt your math:product examples, this is unrelated to lists, math:product builtin doesn't factor objects into subjects
#koo7>	what if it did?
#HMC_a>	so your rdf:first will match leaving ?x unbound, and then math:product will fail the match
#HMC_a>	it doesn't.
#HMC_a>	if it did then it would have to bind each valid factor list in turn
#HMC_a>	but it doesn't... maybe sone other predicate could do that, but that is not the semantics of cwm's math:sum, and it is not a semantic that we would want in a core builtin, due to the complexity of factoring.
#HMC_a>	err, math:product
#HMC_a>	both really?
#koo7>	doesnt matter
#koo7>	pretend it does
#koo7>	now, <HMC_a> ok in rpo-rules.n3 at the bottom
#koo7>	<HMC_a> "support"
#koo7>	{?L rdf:first ?I; a rdf:List} => {?I list:in ?L}.
#HMC_a>	yes?
#koo7>	isnt it the same case?
#HMC_a>	no?
#HMC_a>	note the "?L a rdf:List" guard
#HMC_a>	if ?L is unbound this will fail
#HMC_a>	all lists exist but only specific ones begin with ?I... so this rule only suceeds with specific lists. (tricky, eh?)
#HMC_a>	lists that are assumed to exist are not assumed to be of any particular rdf *type* heh...
#HMC_a>	this is double-tricky, it is because the rule is actually more general, as all containers exist... but I wouldn't worry about this for now, and just stay focused on lists. :-)
#koo7>	so { 25 list:in ?a_list . ?a_list magical:product 25 } => { 25 a SUCCESS } . will fail in cwm?
#koo7>	while ( foo bar baz ) prop2 test6a .
#koo7>	{ foo list:in ?a_list . ?a_list prop2 ?thing } => { ?thing a SUCCESS } .
#koo7>	 suceeds?
#HMC_a>	well i'd have to double check cwm's evaluation order on the first example, but assuming magical:product existed to do factoring I think it would succeed (again, remember cwm is fwd chained and orders things in ways you might not expect, so we are talking about two distinct concerns there wrt if the semantics would align or not)...
#HMC_a>	i'll check it shortly when I get a real break in work :-)
#HMC_a>	wait sorry, no, I think you are correct! I was forgetting that they'd both be builtins, so the eval order is the same, so it *should* fail on list:in I'd expect!
#HMC_a>	it won't ever do the magical:product before the list:in, if i'm recalling it's evaluation strategy correctly
#koo7>	and in tau?
#koo7>	we can rewrite it as { ?a_list rdf:first ?I; a rdf:List. ?a_list magical:product 25.  } .. 
#koo7>	this will succeed if there is accidentally (5 5) foo foo. in the kb but fail otherwise?
	#Quanttek has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
#HMC_a>	sorry had a phone call
#HMC_a>	so maybe math:product/magical:product is not a great example, because it carries some caveats of it's own that I kind forgot about
#HMC_a>	kinda
#HMC_a>	*kinda
#HMC_a>	(specifically (and how's *this* for confusing?) that "?x math:product 25" matches with ?x unbound, but "(?x ?y) math:product 25" will not match... heh, so let's leave that for later)
#koo7>	no match for the lists stuff...
#HMC_a>	you mean wrt "(?x ?y) math:product 25"?
#koo7>	" how's *this* for confusing"
#HMC_a>	well it *is* the lists stuff, ultimately, heh
#HMC_a>	it's just the list details together with math:product details
#HMC_a>	math:product will admit that there exists some factors, but will not find them, basically...
#HMC_a>	anway, that aside
#HMC_a>	22:09 < koo7> and in tau?
#HMC_a>	let's look at your second example
#HMC_a>	this second example will *fail* in tau, yah? :-)
#HMC_a>	because assuming these support rules, "?a_list a rdf:List" will fail in the definition of list:in, so list:in fails, so the rule doesn't fire!
#HMC_a>	now if you changed the order of the body statements then the rule would match... :-|
#HMC_a>	{ ?a_list :prop2 ?thing. :foo llist:in ?a_list . }
#HMC_a>	err
#HMC_a>	list:in
#HMC_a>	because then ?a_list would be bound when calling list:in
#HMC_a>	remember that our logic is ordered where general rdf reasoning is not, heh
#HMC_a>	the semantics of the built-in predicate itself remain the same, but the resolution path around that builtin and it's result is not necessarily
#koo7>	if the subject is bound, and bound to a list just take it's first item.  If it is bound to something that is not a list, fail.  If it is unbound, do a trivial yield (no new binding first).
#koo7>	where does the list of all lists in the kb come in?
#HMC_a>	well tbh now I'm wondering if it does (wrt univar2) :-)
